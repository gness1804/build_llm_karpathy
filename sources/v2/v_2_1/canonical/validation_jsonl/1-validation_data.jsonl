We're all reasonably happy in our lives, though we face a lot of stress. But I've been encountering one particular problem that has caused me to question some of the values I grew up with. Last year, when my car broke down on the side of the road, I waited 3 hours for AAA, but they never came. Just as hour 4 began, a kindly man around my age drove up in his truck and offered to fix the problem, refusing the money I offered as compensation. On a whim, I asked him if he might want to meet for coffee, and we really hit it off. Now we're in a promising relationship. He came from a working class family and aside from his vocational education, hasn't had much formal education; he's an auto mechanic. But after I told my parents about our relationship, they strongly disapproved, making harsh remarks about me throwing away my life with some \"grease monkey\" and emphasizing that both of my siblings were married or engaged to fellow highly paid professionals.\n\nI love my parents, but I don't like the way they're treating me or my partner, and now I'm starting to question the ruthless Type A values I was raised to believe in. I have no desire to throw away my professional career, but I'm also queasy about obsessing over status the way I once did. When it comes to my family, should I just keep them at arm's length for as long as I'm in this relationship? Or do you think it's worth trying to confront them and getting them to see the light?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ANSWER: I would agree that your parents are acting inappropriately. We have enough problems with class and income inequality in our society without people throwing fuel on the fire by acting with such disrespect towards those who are different. (Gets down from the soap box.) The fact and appropriateness of your relationship with a mechanic is none of their business. You definitely should not feel the need to \"hide\" your beau to \"keep them at arm's length\" without first engaging with your parents directly on this matter. If I were in your shoes, I would sit down with the parents if possible (I don't know if you live close enough to them to do that; if not, then consider a good phone conversation.). I would convey to them that while you love them, you also don't like how they've been treating either of you or the snide remarks they've been making about him. You might say something like, \"How would you feel if the roles were reversed, and you were a working-class person being looked down upon by an upper-middle-class professional? Would that make you feel good?\" You might also remind them that assuming you're not part of the 0.01% in this country, there are people above you and your parents on the socio-economic ladder that look down on you just as much as your parents look down on this mechanic. You can also remind them that you're an adult capable of making your own decisions. If you want to flatter them, throw in something about them having equipped you well to make these decisions. But fundamentally, keep to the principle that it's your life, not theirs, and act accordingly. I wish you and your partner every happiness."}]}

Let's call her \"Jeannie.\" And by \"briefly,\" I mean: friendship that quickly evolved, romance that developed even more quickly, a brief sexual encounter, and then painful disengagement on the part of Jeannie. The situation was short but extremely intense, and it was one of the one or two times that I've truly been in love. We were good friends for 6 months after our \"breakup\" and then have remained cordial thereafter. \n\nAfter the romantic liaison with Jeannie ended, I met another woman. She was very different from Jeannie, was more stable and critically, she didn't run away when things got tough. I have been in a serious relationship with this other woman, \"Mira,\" for about a year at this point. We have a good relationship.\n\nJeannie wants to remain friends. The romantic aspect of our relationship is clearly dead, and neither of us has any interest in reviving it. And my relationship with Jeannie ended before my current relationship started. So I have no problem remaining friends. But Mira says it's inappropriate to remain friends with an ex, particularly someone I was with so recently. There's no beef with Jeannie, but she thinks I should cut off contact in the name of our relationship. I'm not happy with this response. I've never cheated on anyone in my life and have no plans to do so. Who's right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ANSWER: Being torn between two people you care about, especially when you don't think that there's a valid reason for the conflict to be there at all, is definitely a distinct kind of pain. In your mind, there's a clear boundary, chronologically and physically, that separates your relationship with Jeannie from that with Mira. Mira feels differently. \n\nBeing friends with an ex is one of those age-old issues dividing good, thoughtful people. One school of thought holds that such a friendship, or indeed any friendship between people with the potential for mutual attraction, is almost always a slippery slope towards inappropriate contact between the two people involved. Call this the \"When Harry Met Sally\" school. The other camp is more permissive of such friendships, as long as appropriate boundaries are maintained. And at the end of the day, it really does depend on the people and the circumstances. I've known of people who were platonic friends with exes for years after the breakup, with no apparent rekindling of any sort of romantic interest between them. And I've also known of people who, um, went the \"When Harry Met Sally\" route.\n\nUltimately, the answer to this question depends on the particulars. What are your partner's reasons for not being comfortable with you continuing to remain friends with this ex? How would you feel if the situation were reversed and she were platonic friends with a guy she had dated previously? You have a right to your own friendships, but her concerns are also valid. If you truly feel that you can maintain a friendship with this ex without any temptations or risk of inappropriate actions, then it might be worth trying to make the friendship work--while also keeping your current partner apprised, of course. Suggest a compromise. For instance, maybe only hang out with Jeannie in group settings or when your partner is there. Or agree to only see Jeannie in public spaces during the day. But if your partner's discomfort would seem to preclude even compromises like this, then you might have to weigh this friendship vs. your current relationship. If it really does seem to be a mutually exclusive choice after ruling out compromises and such, then you'll have to decide whether staying in your current relationship is worth cutting ties with a friend or vice-versa."}]}

She's great in so many ways, but there's one thing that's really bothering me: she's constantly on her phone when we're together. We'll be having dinner, and she'll be scrolling through social media. We'll be watching a movie, and she'll be texting. Even when we're having what I think is an important conversation, she'll pick up her phone to check notifications. I've mentioned it a few times, and she'll put it away for a little while, but then she's right back to it. I feel like I'm competing with her phone for attention, and it's making me feel unimportant. Am I overreacting, or is this a legitimate concern?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ANSWER: You're not overreacting\u2014this is a legitimate concern. When someone is constantly on their phone during shared time, it sends a message that whatever's on the screen is more important than the person in front of them. That's hurtful, and it's reasonable to want your partner's full attention when you're spending time together.\n\nThe fact that she puts it away temporarily when you mention it but then goes back to it suggests this might be more of a habit or compulsion than intentional disregard. Some people genuinely struggle with phone addiction or use their phones as a way to manage anxiety or boredom. But regardless of the reason, it's affecting your relationship, and that needs to be addressed.\n\nHave a direct conversation when you're both calm and not in the middle of a phone-checking moment: \"I love spending time with you, but I've noticed that you're often on your phone when we're together, and it makes me feel like I'm not important to you. I'd like us to have some phone-free time together\u2014maybe during meals, or when we're watching something, or having important conversations. Can we agree on some boundaries around that?\" Be specific about what you need. Maybe phones go in another room during dinner, or you have certain times that are designated as phone-free. If she's resistant or dismissive of your feelings, that's a bigger problem. But if she's willing to work on it, you might need to help her by suggesting alternatives\u2014maybe she needs to address underlying anxiety, or maybe your time together needs to be made more engaging so she's less tempted to reach for her phone. The goal is to find a balance where you both feel present and connected.\n\nAs a coda, I will add that there are also apps out there that limit access to distracting apps. These apps allow someone to set restrictions around the use of distracting apps (such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, or any apps one chooses). These are often time-based (e.g., during working hours or during the evenings) but can also have settings such as limiting the amount of time someone can open such apps in a day. One of the best of these is called Opal. Such an app might also be a solution if, as you mentioned, her heavy phone use is more of an unconscious habit than a conscious effort to avoid talking to you. I'd recommend looking into these apps."}]}

What\u2019s the right way to navigate this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ANSWER: Situations like this are tricky and require clear boundaries. You are caught between protecting the friend's confidence and your own hesitation at carrying a secret that you really shouldn't have to carry. You should make clear to the friend that he should reach out to other people who are better able to assist him. Begin by validating his feelings. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you trusted me enough to share this.\u201d Then pivot gently toward your boundary: \u201cBut I\u2019m not the right person to carry this alone. You deserve support from people who love you, and I can\u2019t hold this in isolation.\u201d\n\nEncourage him to tell your husband directly. Offer support if he wants help framing the conversation. Men are notoriously hesitant to share sensitive things like this with other men, which is probably why he told you instead of your husband directly. But telling your husband would be a much more appropriate choice, since after all, his best friend is your husband, not you. Make an offer to the friend that helps to break down these self-imposed male barriers regarding hard topics. \u201cI think it would be good for you to talk with him. If you want, I can sit with you when you tell him.\u201d This takes a lot of the pressure off of him and makes it not just a man-to-man encounter, but also an encounter including you. Gender matters a lot in these types of situations, but it doesn't have to be an insurmountable barrier against getting help.\n\nIf he still refuses to tell your husband, you may need to prioritize safety over secrecy. Mental health struggles are not casual confidences. You need to be firm but non-threatening with the friend that this isn't something he can just tell you and then pretend like nothing is going on. You might say: \u201cI\u2019m worried about you, and I can\u2019t keep this from him if it means you won\u2019t get the support you need.\u201d \n\nThis isn\u2019t betrayal.

We've been together for two years, and even though we've had our ups and downs, it's mostly been great. But we've hit a major snag when it comes to wedding planning. Since he proposed months ago, our first concern has been cost. We're both graduate students, and we're several years away from being able to make good money. I come from a modest background where there was never much extra money growing up. But my fianc\u00e9's family is much wealthier. His parents agreed to pay for the entire wedding, which really floored me and was something that we gratefully accepted. But there was a catch. Since they've agreed to fund the wedding, they've been trying to dictate to us non-stop every little detail, right down to the color of the flowers. They've even hinted in a backhanded way that they might withdraw financial support for our wedding if we don't do things exactly their way.\n\nI understand the need to take family concerns into consideration when planning a wedding, but we want to be able to make a lot of decisions ourselves. After all, we're the ones getting married. My dilemma is whether or not to just suck it up and let them dictate how the wedding should be done to the last detail, or whether we should push back. A third option would be to elope, which honestly part of me really wants to do. But I've always wanted a big wedding and really hope that we can somehow have our cake and eat it too. How do you suggest approaching this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ANSWER: I'm sorry that your dream wedding is coming with so many strings attached, but unfortunately, that's fairly common. What I'd suggest you do first is have an honest conversation with your fianc\u00e9. Sit down and discuss: what are the essentials that you must have in your wedding? What are some things you can negotiate? And what are some things that you don't particularly care about? Then, you might want to make a list as to what your preferences are in each of those categories versus what his parents' preferences are. This will help you have a holistic view to see whether there's enough alignment with their preferences to, as you say, \"suck it up\" and go along with what they want.\n\nIf you're generally okay with their direction but have a few deal-breakers, then I would suggest talking to them in a compassionate and loving manner. Tell them that you're extremely grateful for their support for the wedding, but there are a few details that you want to have different than what they envision. Hopefully, they'll be reasonable and accept that not every little detail can be dictated by them regardless of who's paying. And then there's the nuclear option of either eloping or holding a much more modest wedding within your means. I wouldn't rule this out, especially if your preliminary discussion with your partner reveals that there are just too many differences between your vision of the wedding and what his parents' vision of the wedding is. Weddings tend to be unconscionably expensive, but there are definitely ways that you can reduce costs. Having a small guest list is the most obvious of these, though of course that comes with its own social politics. I'd also recommend that you check out \"The Budget-Savvy Wedding Planner & Organizer: Checklists, Worksheets, and Essential Tools to Plan the Perfect Wedding on a Small Budget\" by Jessica Bishop. It's chock-full of useful suggestions on how to economize wedding planning and still have a beautiful and meaningful ceremony without breaking the bank. Good luck."}]}

You might also consider whether there are family members who are more accepting\u2014maybe you can maintain relationships with those individuals separately, while limiting contact with those who are hostile. Ultimately, if your family can't accept your partner, that's their loss. You're building a life with someone you love, and that's what matters.

How do I express concern without sounding judgmental or territorial?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ANSWER: Start with curiosity rather than conclusions. You might say: \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy. I\u2019ve noticed a few moments where it seemed like your partner talked over you or dismissed your ideas. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just their style, but I wanted to check in about how you\u2019re feeling in the relationship.\u201d\n\nThis approach centers his experience rather than your interpretation. You\u2019re not telling him what to think. You\u2019re inviting him to reflect. As you've alluded to, new relationships involve constant conscious and unconscious filtering. We downplay or ignore the negative things we see from our new love interest while amplifying the positives. So it's natural that he has the rosy-eyed glasses on. But gently pointing out these concerns could send a signal that could become useful once the rosy-eyed glasses come off. You're not only pointing out red flags to him; you're also setting yourself up to be a source of support and a landing spot if or when all this goes south.\n\nIf he brushes it off, don\u2019t push. Instead, keep the door open: \u201cIf anything ever feels off, I\u2019m here.\u201d That reassures him and subtly conveys your concern without coming off as overbearing.\n\nIf the relationship is healthy, your concern won\u2019t harm it. If it isn\u2019t, your comment might be the seed that helps him notice patterns later. Either way, you\u2019ve spoken with care rather than judgment."}]}

And it doesn't sound like these circumstances apply in your case. The fact that you've already confronted her and made clear what the problem is, and that she doesn't seem willing or able to change her behavior, indicates a larger issue. You will have to make clear to her the gravity of the situation, and if necessary, stop sharing sensitive personal information with her if the behavior continues.\n\nStart with clarity: \u201cWhen I share personal things with you, I expect them to stay between us unless I explicitly say otherwise.\u201d Don\u2019t soften it into a suggestion. Frame it as the baseline requirement for trust. Then explain the emotional impact: \u201cWhen you share my private information, I feel exposed and misunderstood. It makes me hesitate to open up at all.\u201d If she offers a rationalization, such as, \"I'm just trying to help people understand your circumstances,\" push back. \u201cI understand you mean well, but this information is not yours to share. If I want other loved ones to be privy to this information, then I will share it myself. Please trust that I have the judgment to be able to do this.\u201d\n\nFrom there, set a forward-looking rule: \u201cIf you\u2019re ever unsure whether something is private, assume it is. Ask me first before sharing it with anyone else.\u201d With anything that's at all sensitive, she needs to ask you before sharing it. End of discussion.\n\nIf she still minimizes your concern, stay steady: \u201cIntentions aside, the impact is real. I need this boundary respected.\u201d\n\nRebuilding trust takes time, but consistency helps. If she proves she can hold confidentiality moving forward, the relationship will strengthen. If she can\u2019t, then you will know that you simply can't share private or sensitive information with her anymore. Not out of punishment, but in order to protect yourself. Love doesn't justify allowing your sister to become a sieve with your most private and intimate information."}]}

But there's one issue that's been bothering me: he's still very close with his ex-girlfriend. They text regularly, hang out one-on-one, and he even invited her to a party at his place recently. When I asked him about it, he said they're just friends and that their relationship was never that serious anyway. I trust him, but it still makes me uncomfortable.

The question isn't whether it's \"normal\" to be friends with an ex, but whether this particular friendship is appropriate and respectful of your current relationship. There are some red flags here: the one-on-one hangouts, the regular texting, and the fact that he's including her in his social life in a way that might be making you feel like a third wheel.\n\nBefore you ask him to change anything, you need to understand what's really going on. Have a calm conversation: \"I trust you, but I'm feeling uncomfortable with how close you are with your ex. Can you help me understand the friendship? What does it look like from your perspective?\" Pay attention to his response. Does he dismiss your feelings? Does he get defensive? Or does he listen and try to help you understand? A partner who cares about your feelings will want to address your discomfort, even if they don't agree that there's a problem. You might find that there are reasonable boundaries you can both agree on\u2014maybe group hangouts are fine, but one-on-one dinners feel too intimate. Or maybe you can all hang out together so you can see their dynamic for yourself. But if he's unwilling to make any adjustments or if his friendship with his ex is more important than your comfort in the relationship, that tells you something about his priorities. You're not being unreasonable to want boundaries around ex-relationships\u2014that's a very common need in romantic partnerships."}]}

Things have been going really well between us. I mean, we have our issues like every couple, but overall, things are great. I love him, he loves me, we both love each other's families. The problem is that he's expressed interest in opening up the relationship. I'm not enthused about the idea. Although I don't consider myself particularly religious or traditional, I do think that intimate relationships should be one-on-one. No judgment towards anybody else, but that's how I want my own life to be. He says that he wants to explore other people outside the relationship but remain committed to me. He cited several examples of our friends who have done it and he emphasizes that I would always remain his primary partner. He also said that I can meet any and all of his other partners and that he would be above board about everything. I have no reason to think he's seeing someone behind my back. He's always been honest. But I don't really feel comfortable with an open relationship. I've expressed this, but he keeps bringing it up. Is there hope for us?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ANSWER: Polyamorous relationships are increasingly common nowadays. I think you have the right approach by being non-judgmental, but also by knowing what you want personally. Since he has mentioned it multiple times even though you've expressed not wanting to pursue this, this seems like a fundamental incompatibility issue. How exactly does he respond when you tell him you're not interested? Is it dismissive, or does it seem sincere? Polyamory is something that both relationship partners have to sign off on. And in fact, not just sign off on, but be committed to. In spite of common misconceptions, polyamory takes just as much commitment as a traditional monogamous relationship, and in some ways even more, since it's incumbent upon each partner to inform their original partner of everyone else they're sleeping with, plus get STD tests and do other due diligence. And there are always concerns about developing an emotional connection with a secondary partner that outweighs that with a primary partner.\n\nThe fundamental question is whether you want a polyamorous relationship or keep your current partner. Apparently you can't have both. I would have one more conversation with him in which you are crystal clear that you love him and you want to stay with him, but polyamory just isn't for you. Tell him that if he truly wants a polyamorous relationship, that it won't work out between you two. Ask him point-blank if he wants to go ahead with polyamory or if he wants to remain with you. Emphasize that he can't have both--in a loving way, of course, not in a way that sounds like an ultimatum. I know that even broaching the subject of a breakup can be very painful in a relationship as committed as yours seems to be. But better to determine that now rather than later. Good luck."}]}

It's heartbreaking, but staying together when you want fundamentally different things will only lead to resentment\u2014either you'll resent her for \"depriving\" you of parenthood, or she'll resent you if she has a child she doesn't want. Neither outcome is fair to either of you, or to a potential child.

I don\u2019t see independence as a flaw, but he seems genuinely hurt. How do I respond without apologizing for who I am?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ANSWER: Independence is not a character defect, nor does it automatically render one's partner \"unnecessary.\" For many people, it is a hard-earned strength that reflects resilience, self-trust, and a stable sense of identity. It\u2019s understandable that you don\u2019t want to apologize for that. Nor should you.\n\nThis behavior on the part of your partner could reflect a controlling nature or it could simply mean that he is insecure about something. Men in our society are socialized to feel a strong need to be useful. If they perceive that this is no longer the case, it often causes anxiety and insecurity, which can be expressed in multiple ways, including criticizing a partner for supposedly being too independent. On the other hand, controlling partners often try to make their partners dependent on them. Does your partner engage in any other controlling behaviors?\n\nIf this is a case of a controlling partner, you should seek the exit as soon as possible. But if it's just insecurity that's causing your partner to react this way, then there are ways to work with him to address this. You can affirm the relationship without disowning your independence. You might say something like: \u201cI value you and choose you. My independence isn\u2019t about pushing you away; it\u2019s about being whole as a person. I want us to be partners, rather than one of us depending on the other.\u201d \n\nIf this is reflective of a fear of being unneeded or replaceable, then that fear deserves empathy, but it does not justify asking you to become smaller or less capable. Independence is not a zero-sum game. One partner's independence does not depend on the other losing it.\n\nIf your reassurance doesn\u2019t land, the issue may not be your independence at all. It may be a mismatch in expectations about what closeness should look like. A healthy relationship makes room for two complete people standing side by side, not one person shrinking so the other can feel essential. Reassuring someone you love shouldn't come at the cost of making yourself smaller."}]}

We've been talking about having kids, but we have very different ideas about parenting. I was raised with strict rules, clear consequences, and high expectations. My partner was raised in a much more permissive household where kids had a lot of freedom and choices. I think kids need structure and boundaries to thrive, while my partner thinks too many rules stifle creativity and independence. We've tried to discuss this, but we both get defensive because our approaches are tied to our own childhood experiences. How do we figure out a parenting style we can both agree on before we have kids?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ANSWER: This is exactly the kind of conversation you need to have before having children, so good on you for recognizing it. The key is to move away from \"my way vs. your way\" and toward \"what works best for kids.\" Start by reading some evidence-based parenting books together\u2014look for sources that cite research rather than just personal philosophy. Books like \"The Whole-Brain Child\" by Daniel Siegel or \"How to Talk So Kids Will Listen\" by Adele Faber can give you a shared foundation based on child development research rather than your individual upbringings.\n\nThen, instead of debating strict vs. permissive, talk about specific scenarios: \"How would we handle it if our 5-year-old refuses to go to bed?\" or \"What do we do if our teenager wants to go to a party we're not comfortable with?\" Focus on the principles behind your approaches\u2014you value structure and safety, your partner values autonomy and trust. Both are valid, and the best parenting often combines elements of both. You might find that you can agree on boundaries around safety and health (non-negotiable) while giving kids more freedom in areas like hobbies or clothing choices (negotiable). Consider taking a parenting class together or seeing a couples therapist who specializes in pre-parenting counseling. The goal isn't to convince each other that one approach is right, but to build a shared philosophy that incorporates both of your values."}]}

Start by telling each of them privately, and gently, that you\u2019re stepping out of the middle. Something like: \u201cI care about you, but I can\u2019t be part of conversations that pull me into conflict with the other person.

You all have a right to be able to spend time together without constantly feeling like you're walking on eggshells. Have you spoken privately with some other group members about this? Not to gossip, but to try to get on the same page about how to handle it. It's likely that others feel the same as you do about the situation. \n\nThis additional support might help you to set a consistent boundary in group settings.

You\u2019re declining the invitation to be collateral.

You\u2019re allowed to curate your social life. Caring about people doesn\u2019t require absorbing their unresolved conflicts.\n\nYou\u2019re choosing self-preservation, not sides."}]}

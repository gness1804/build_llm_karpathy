QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for 10 years, and while it's mostly been a good marriage with the usual ups and downs, a toxic dynamic has evolved where both of us rush to blame the other during arguments. For example, last week our cat escaped and my youngest child and I spent several hours looking for her before a neighbor thankfully found and returned her. The relief of having her back should have been the end of it, but instead the incident sparked a painful argument about whose "fault" it was—-my husband blamed me for leaving the door open when I went out to tend to our plants (I was only outside for a few minutes), while I blamed him because the only reason I went out to water the plants was that he had neglected to do it after saying he would take care of them. The argument was unproductive, as almost all our arguments are. We've been in couples therapy but haven't made much progress, in part because my husband doesn't take therapy seriously. How can we overcome this blame dynamic and develop a better marital relationship?

ANSWER: This is a common problem, so you're hardly alone in facing this. Your husband's reluctance to take therapy seriously is discouraging, but there are other approaches you can take. During a moment when both of you are calm, approach him and say something like, "Honey, I've noticed that when we fight, we often blame each other for problems, and this doesn't resolve anything. It just results in hurt feelings for both of us. What do you think we can do to address this?"

Much will depend on how he responds. If he doesn't respond well, particularly after repeated attempts to address this amicably, then it might behoove you to engage in solo therapy to explore any underlying problems behind this pattern. But if he is open to engaging with you, try this exercise: the next time you have an argument and one of you starts blaming the other, get out a piece of paper and each of you write down possible solutions, with a rule that nobody can write anything blaming the other partner—just focus on solutions. Blame is a dynamic that tends to be self-reinforcing: the more you resort to blame, the more it feels natural, but the good news is that it works the other way as well—the less you engage in blame over time, the less it becomes the default way of "solving" problems. Over time, this exercise should help change this difficult dynamic while also solving the original problems more quickly. I would also recommend reading John Gottman's book, "The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work," which contains excellent advice about the blame game and other marital challenges.

QUESTION: Like so many others, my teenage daughter is struggling with an eating disorder. In her case, she's lost so many pounds in the last few weeks that she barely resembles her old self. She's obsessed with the idea that she's fat, but in reality, she's dangerously underweight. Making matters worse, my husband seems to not take her situation seriously enough. While I fear for her life if she doesn't get treatment soon, my husband often brushes off the subject when I talk to him about it. He says things like, "Oh, she's just going through a phase," or "Maybe she just doesn't like the food that you cook." I think that my daughter is overhearing this and it might be encouraging her to starve herself even more.

I've always been the non-confrontational type, which I fear has contributed to my daughter getting into the mess that she's in. So I'm not really sure how to confront my husband about this. What do you suggest?

ANSWER: As you noted, this is a life-or-death situation. What I would do is urgently get both your daughter and husband educated on the serious problem of eating disorders, "tout de suite." First, if you haven't already, inform your daughter of the following resources: the 24/7 eating disorder hotline (866-932-1264) and the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD) Helpline (888-375-7767). I would also insist that both your daughter and your husband visit the website of the National Eating Disorders Association, particularly their helpful article "Busting The Myths About Eating Disorders" (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/busting-myths-about-eating-disorders/). 

The immediate problem, of course, is helping your daughter to get healthy and overcome the disorder, and to learn the skills needed to prevent relapses in the future. This starts with a conversation with her primary care physician and also her therapist, if she has one. But I suspect you're doing most of this already. What you wrote to me about was really a problem of attitudes and education on the part of your husband. In addition to showing him the above-mentioned resources, I would have a serious conversation with him about how his attitudes might be harming his daughter. There is also some underlying sexism and misogyny in his remarks, particularly about what he said about the food that you cook. But educating him on eating disorders is the first priority. Then you can have a longer discussion with him (ideally also with a couples therapist) addressing some of these problematic assumptions that he seems to have about you and about gender roles.

Finally, by all means, whenever your husband makes one of these remarks and there's even the possibility that your daughter could have been around, seek her out at your first opportunity and emphasize to her that what her father said was wrong. Tell her the facts in a calm manner, not to demonize her father but rather to show that his harmful views aren't correct. Facts and sincere affirmation are the best antidotes to misguided and harmful ignorance.

QUESTION: My husband and I are facing a dilemma over how to respond to a problem with how his family treats his brother. We both have long suspected that my husband's brother is gay. At one point, the brother even came to my husband asking for advice on how to come out of the closet. However, in large part because of their family's attitudes, the brother has never actually come out to them. From time to time, I overhear some of my husband's family, particularly my father-in-law, make offensive and cruel remarks about gay people. I don't know if the father-in-law suspects that one of his sons is gay or not, but regardless, this creates an alienating environment for us and obviously especially for the brother.

Our dilemma is on how to respond to this, if at all. I would like for us, or at least for my husband, to bring this up with his father and to make clear that we don't approve of these cruel remarks. My husband has made it clear that even though he strongly disapproves of the anti-gay remarks, he wants to preserve his relationship with his father and doesn't want to intervene. I tend to feel that since it's his family, he should have more of a say on how to engage with them. But it really hurts to stand by and say nothing while my husband's father creates such an intolerant environment. Do you think that we should just let this go or do you feel that it's worth risking our relationship with his father to try to improve the situation?

ANSWER: What about the brother's opinion of all this? Before confronting his father, why don't you two, or just your husband, approach the brother and gently ask him what he thinks the best course of action is? Given that he seems to be the one most affected by the remarks, his opinion should be given special weight. Only confront the father if the brother is okay with that. You don't want to risk a backlash by confronting the father and then him responding by treating his son even worse. And even though what the father is saying is clearly abhorrent, the son that you suspect is gay might have his own reasons for wanting to preserve his own relationship with his father.

Regardless of whether you choose to confront the father directly, there are more subtle ways that you can send signals of disapproval about the remarks. For instance, you can limit your visits to those particular relatives when the father is around. You can also invite the brother to spend more time with you and your husband separately, apart from his parents. And the next time you happen to overhear a remark, you might consider going the route of asking a question as opposed to direct confrontation. That is, maybe you could ask the father, "If you were gay, how would you feel about other people saying that about you?" I've often found that when dealing with difficult people, asking them respectful but direct critical questions is often a more effective strategy than simply laying down the law and telling them that they're wrong. Although I admit, I'm human too, and often the temptation for the latter is quite strong in that type of situation. But whatever approach you take, remember that empathy and compassion should be your guiding lights. Make sure that the brother's needs are first and foremost in whatever solution you decide on.

QUESTION: My wife and I are expecting our first child, a daughter. As you might imagine, we're over the moon about being new parents and nurturing and loving this new human. Nevertheless, my wife and I are engaged in a nasty recurring argument over whether to baptize our future daughter. My wife came from a fairly secular family but experienced trauma in her early adulthood, including a sexual assault. She found an on-campus religious community that provided tremendous support to her in her healing. And after college she has continued to attend church in that same denomination. She's been a part of this denomination for about 15 years at this point, and I have nothing against her doing this. Obviously she's an autonomous adult, and we don't have to agree on religion. But in my case, I'm an atheist who had some very bad experiences with religion growing up, including multiple attempts to proselytize me. I also had a friend who was abused by a priest. And so for me, organized religion is the root of much evil with corporate greed being the root of most of the rest.

My wife wants to baptize our daughter in her denomination because she wants to pass on to her child the deep connection that she has to her faith. And also, I suspect, because she feels that on some level being part of this religious community might shield her daughter from the trauma that she went through as a younger woman. But for me, I worry that baptizing our daughter in this religion would essentially brainwash and indoctrinate her. I fear our daughter wanting to marry young and then becoming obedient to her husband due to our church's teachings. The denomination is one of the more conservative ones, and I don't agree with most of their teachings. I want our daughter to be a strong young woman, not a slave to her future husband because of religious brainwashing. Should I just give in and let her get indoctrinated, or should I fight harder for her to not be baptized?

ANSWER: It seems like you're falling into a trap that many religious and secular people alike fall into: framing a problem as a strict black-and-white either/or matter. Fundamentally, it seems to me that both you and your wife are coming from a place of love, and your differences are rooted in very different life experiences with religion. I don't know how much you've talked to your wife about this, but if you haven't, I would suggest first having an open and frank discussion with her about religion in general and what it means to each of you. Frame this in a way that respects her beliefs and life experiences while also reminding her that yours are just as valid, and agree to temporarily stay away from the subject of your daughter's potential baptism. This might help you two to get on the same page on religion in general, and not just over the question of baptizing your daughter. 

Then, when you two have found some common ground over religion (even if it is very limited), return to the subject of the baptism. There might be multiple ways to skin this cat that respect both of your viewpoints and beliefs. For instance, might you agree to having the daughter baptized in a more liberal denomination? This might satisfy your wife's wishes for her to be baptized as a Christian without being baptized in the same denomination whose beliefs you find so problematic. This might seem like an unacceptable compromise, but it's worked for a lot of couples. For instance, when I was dating my wife, I was very reluctant to convert to the dominant religion of her family because I found it unpalatable in many ways. But we compromised, and I converted into a more liberal denomination of the faith, which ended up working out fairly well for us. And don't forget to keep in mind the bigger picture of what your daughter herself might eventually want. Hopefully you and your wife would both agree that when your daughter is old enough to do so, she should be the one to determine her future path, be it a religious path or a secular one. So I think it makes sense to expose her to a mixture of religious and secular viewpoints. The exact contours of this will, of course, be up to you and your wife and eventually up to her. But by coming from a place of compassion and love, you will put her in a position to be well-equipped to make her own faith decision when the time comes.

QUESTION: I am the oldest of three daughters, and my family has always placed a heavy emphasis on achievement and success, conventionally defined—my father is a physician, and my mother is a renowned lawyer, and my younger siblings and I all followed in their footsteps, becoming professionals of various stripes. We're all reasonably happy in our lives, though we face a lot of stress. But I've been encountering one particular problem that has caused me to question some of the values I grew up with. Last year, when my car broke down on the side of the road, I waited 3 hours for AAA, but they never came. Just as hour 4 began, a kindly man around my age drove up in his truck and offered to fix the problem, refusing the money I offered as compensation. On a whim, I asked him if he might want to meet for coffee, and we really hit it off. Now we're in a promising relationship. He came from a working class family and aside from his vocational education, hasn't had much formal education; he's an auto mechanic. But after I told my parents about our relationship, they strongly disapproved, making harsh remarks about me throwing away my life with some "grease monkey" and emphasizing that both of my siblings were married or engaged to fellow highly paid professionals.

I love my parents, but I don't like the way they're treating me or my partner, and now I'm starting to question the ruthless Type A values I was raised to believe in. I have no desire to throw away my professional career, but I'm also queasy about obsessing over status the way I once did. When it comes to my family, should I just keep them at arm's length for as long as I'm in this relationship? Or do you think it's worth trying to confront them and getting them to see the light?

ANSWER: I would agree that your parents are acting inappropriately. We have enough problems with class and income inequality in our society without people throwing fuel on the fire by acting with such disrespect towards those who are different. (Gets down from the soap box.) The fact and appropriateness of your relationship with a mechanic is none of their business. You definitely should not feel the need to "hide" your beau to "keep them at arm's length" without first engaging with your parents directly on this matter. If I were in your shoes, I would sit down with the parents if possible (I don't know if you live close enough to them to do that; if not, then consider a good phone conversation.). I would convey to them that while you love them, you also don't like how they've been treating either of you or the snide remarks they've been making about him. You might say something like, "How would you feel if the roles were reversed, and you were a working-class person being looked down upon by an upper-middle-class professional? Would that make you feel good?" You might also remind them that assuming you're not part of the 0.01% in this country, there are people above you and your parents on the socio-economic ladder that look down on you just as much as your parents look down on this mechanic. You can also remind them that you're an adult capable of making your own decisions. If you want to flatter them, throw in something about them having equipped you well to make these decisions. But fundamentally, keep to the principle that it's your life, not theirs, and act accordingly. I wish you and your partner every happiness.

QUESTION: I'm engaged to a wonderful man. We've been together for two years, and even though we've had our ups and downs, it's mostly been great. But we've hit a major snag when it comes to wedding planning. Since he proposed months ago, our first concern has been cost. We're both graduate students, and we're several years away from being able to make good money. I come from a modest background where there was never much extra money growing up. But my fiancé's family is much wealthier. His parents agreed to pay for the entire wedding, which really floored me and was something that we gratefully accepted. But there was a catch. Since they've agreed to fund the wedding, they've been trying to dictate to us non-stop every little detail, right down to the color of the flowers. They've even hinted in a backhanded way that they might withdraw financial support for our wedding if we don't do things exactly their way.

I understand the need to take family concerns into consideration when planning a wedding, but we want to be able to make a lot of decisions ourselves. After all, we're the ones getting married. My dilemma is whether or not to just suck it up and let them dictate how the wedding should be done to the last detail, or whether we should push back. A third option would be to elope, which honestly part of me really wants to do. But I've always wanted a big wedding and really hope that we can somehow have our cake and eat it too. How do you suggest approaching this?

ANSWER: I'm sorry that your dream wedding is coming with so many strings attached, but unfortunately, that's fairly common. What I'd suggest you do first is have an honest conversation with your fiancé. Sit down and discuss: what are the essentials that you must have in your wedding? What are some things you can negotiate? And what are some things that you don't particularly care about? Then, you might want to make a list as to what your preferences are in each of those categories versus what his parents' preferences are. This will help you have a holistic view to see whether there's enough alignment with their preferences to, as you say, "suck it up" and go along with what they want.

If you're generally okay with their direction but have a few deal-breakers, then I would suggest talking to them in a compassionate and loving manner. Tell them that you're extremely grateful for their support for the wedding, but there are a few details that you want to have different than what they envision. Hopefully, they'll be reasonable and accept that not every little detail can be dictated by them regardless of who's paying. And then there's the nuclear option of either eloping or holding a much more modest wedding within your means. I wouldn't rule this out, especially if your preliminary discussion with your partner reveals that there are just too many differences between your vision of the wedding and what his parents' vision of the wedding is. Weddings tend to be unconscionably expensive, but there are definitely ways that you can reduce costs. Having a small guest list is the most obvious of these, though of course that comes with its own social politics. I'd also recommend that you check out "The Budget-Savvy Wedding Planner & Organizer: Checklists, Worksheets, and Essential Tools to Plan the Perfect Wedding on a Small Budget" by Jessica Bishop. It's chock-full of useful suggestions on how to economize wedding planning and still have a beautiful and meaningful ceremony without breaking the bank. Good luck.

QUESTION: My best friend recently got back together with her ex-boyfriend, who I know was emotionally abusive to her. She cut off her other best friend for telling her to leave him, and now she's threatening to cut me off too over a trivial political disagreement we had. I'm trying to be a safe presence for her like people advised, but it's getting harder as she keeps ghosting me or being cold and distant. How do I handle this without losing my friend completely, and how do I stop feeling terrible about it?

ANSWER: You can't fix this for her, and you shouldn't try to. Your friend is in a cycle of abuse where she's isolating herself from people who care about her—this is unfortunately common in abusive relationships. The person who's supposed to be her safe place (you) is being pushed away, while the person causing harm is being drawn closer. Your role right now isn't to be a regular friend who gets regular friendship back. It's to be a lifeline that stays available even when she's not using it.

That means: keep reaching out periodically with low-pressure check-ins. Don't expect her to respond, and don't take her distance personally. When she does respond, don't lecture her about the boyfriend—just be present. Say things like, "I'm here whenever you need me, no questions asked." The goal is to make sure she knows you're still there when she's ready to leave. As for feeling terrible about it—that's actually appropriate. It is terrible to watch someone you care about self-destruct. But remember: her choices aren't your fault, and you can't rescue her if she doesn't want to be rescued. You can only keep the door open. In the meantime, make sure you're taking care of yourself. This is emotionally draining work, and you deserve support too. Consider talking to a therapist or joining a support group for friends and family of people in abusive relationships.

QUESTION: My wife and I have been married about 15 years. For the first few years, our sex life was great. We were, as the saying goes, "f***ing like bunnies". But as the years wore on, especially once we had kids, we hit a rough spot in the bedroom. Since we had our second and final child, my wife only wants sex once every few weeks, and sometimes once every few months. When we do have sex, I almost always have to initiate, and she's just not as, shall we say, vigorous as was the case before. I love my wife and want to respect her preferences, but at the same time, I feel that my sexual needs are no longer being met. Am I doomed to spend the rest of my days in a sexually unsatisfying marriage, or is there hope for us?

ANSWER: As you might be aware, this is a very common problem, but that doesn't make it any less painful. Since there is such a huge spectrum of sexual desire/libido among humans, it's very likely that any given marriage will have a mismatch in libido, be it large or small. Working this out depends on many things, particularly: How large the libido gap is, the personalities of the partners, and how open both partners are to compromise.

There are, of course, a few basic ground rules: First, nobody should ever have sex that they don't want to have. And second, any negotiations or discussions about sex should be done in a loving and compassionate manner.

With that in mind, have a frank discussion with your wife about this issue. Frame the problem not as her not giving you what you want, but rather as an apparent mismatch in sexual interest. Don't frame your own higher libido as better or normative. Approach this in a compassionate manner, and ask if she might be willing to compromise. For instance, ask if you both could have sex a little more often, but still within her comfort zone. Also, there is a lot of stigma around this, but there is no shame in satisfying your needs on the side as long as it doesn't involve an extra-marital affair. That is, as long as it's done ethically. By this I mean, well, sometimes taking solo flights when the dual flight is canceled or delayed. Almost all married people, even in happy marriages, satisfy themselves sometimes. And that's perfectly normal, as long as it doesn't substitute for your actual sex life. For a compassionate and common-sense view of such matters, and male sexuality in general, I'd highly recommend checking out Bernie Zilbergeld's book, "The New Male Sexuality." It's an oldie but goodie that even after a few decades still stands the test of time.

QUESTION: My husband has a habit of criticizing me when I do something wrong, or when he thinks I do something wrong. This behavior has unfortunately been escalating in recent months. It started even before our wedding. For instance, he would remark upon my having chosen the "wrong" dress rather than telling a white lie that he liked the dress. Also, he would say things like, "You must be so glad you found me given how you were living before." Like most people in love, I brushed off these red flags, thinking that he would change after the wedding. But alas, things only got worse from there. Now that we've been married several years and have two kids, he started insulting me in front of the kids. He also tries to make me believe things that I know aren't true. For instance, by repeating lies to me, such as accusing me of losing our house keys, when in fact he's the one who misplaced them. They were found in the pocket of his suit jacket, for goodness sake!

My husband is mostly a wonderful man and a good father, and I dread the prospect of becoming a single mother, so I don't want to lose him. I've tried talking with him about the insults, but he always brushes me off. Is there a way that I can address this to salvage the marriage? Or do you think I should seek the exit?

ANSWER: Oh my goodness, you should run and not walk to the exit door. This is a textbook case of emotional and verbal abuse and gaslighting. Your husband insults you even after you've pointed it out and asked him to stop. He tries to get you to believe things that you know aren't true, and thus to undermine your confidence in yourself and your sense of reality, which is the definition of gaslighting. And he's doing it in front of your children. You even say that these are "red flags." This marriage is clearly beyond the point of no return. Rather than trying to change him, you should look for the safest and quickest way out of the marriage, which I know won't be easy.

The good news is that there are resources for domestic violence victims like you to get out safely. The first steps should be to find a time when he's not around and call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. This service is available in many languages to anyone in need. They will help you devise an escape plan. Also, what support network do you have? Do you have a mother or sister or brother or best friend who could help you? Talk to someone you trust about the situation. Hopefully, they will see the obvious fact that this is domestic abuse and they will rush to help. If not, don't let them convince you that what you're seeing isn't true. Go to somebody else you trust. If you don't have anyone around you to trust, find a local women's shelter. They can provide you with a lot of resources. And when the time comes, of course, you'll need to visit an attorney. But your safety comes before everything else. You deserve much better, and you need to get out now. Good luck to you.

QUESTION: I'm engaged to be married to a wonderful man. We met online about a year and a half ago. When he proposed, I was truly over the moon. This has been a fairytale story, except for one major aspect: my extremely religious sister doesn't approve of him. Why? It boils down to the fact that he's divorced. In our religious tradition, if you enter into marriage with somebody, even if the marriage itself was not in this tradition, and you then divorce, our church has to find a reason why the divorce is invalid to permit the person to marry a second time within this church. It's called an annulment. My fiance has been willing to go quite far for my family with regards to religion, including even getting baptized, albeit not in our same denomination. But very reasonably, he's decided not to do an annulment on the grounds that it would be an unacceptable intrusion into his private life. And he's right. We don't need priests digging into his past life.

But this refusal to do the annulment is a deal-breaker for my sister, who will only attend my wedding if the annulment happens and if my fiance gets baptized into the "right" sect. It's looking like a real possibility that my sister will skip the wedding. I really want her there, and I've tried to explain this to her and get her to understand that even though she may not agree with the wedding or with my choice of a partner, she needs to attend because that's what sisters who love their sisters do. I am politically liberal, but if she were to marry someone who's a huge Trump supporter and conservative, I wouldn't hesitate to attend. (She is single now.) Because again that's what sisters do.

Is there a way that I can approach the topic that I haven't thought of that might help come around to seeing reason, or should I just deal with not having my beloved sister at the wedding? (Oh, and one thing I forgot to mention, I encouraged her to see a priest to discuss this matter in the hope that he would tell her something along the lines of: "Yes, go to the wedding because you love your sister and it's the right thing to do. It's not anything that will undermine your faith or commitment to God." But she won't go, and my husband suspects the reason is because she knows that the priest will probably say something along these lines.)

ANSWER: Your predicament is unfortunate, and I'm sorry you have to go through that. Unfortunately, when dealing with other adults, there's always only so much that you can do to get them to do what you want. It seems like you have tried to engage her in a loving and compassionate manner, and try to convince her to come to the wedding, but it sounds like she won't budge. You might try one more time with something along the lines of: "[Sister], I know that you love me and I love you. And I would gladly attend your wedding if you have one in the future, regardless of the groom that you choose or what his faith is. So can you please find it within yourself to come to our wedding? It's not going to be any judgment on you or your faith. It's just an expression of love for me, and it would mean the world to me."

My only other real suggestion to try to get her to come around would be something that you've already effectively ruled out: talking to a faith leader in her tradition about the subject. You might still consider talking to a faith leader yourself and with your partner, but without your sister present. Not because you think he's going to give you some sort of argument to convince her to come to the wedding, but just to hear his perspective. (If this is the faith that I think it is, the priest will only be a "he".) He might give you a compassionate perspective on accepting your sister not coming to the wedding because realistically, that seems to be your only real option at this point assuming that your Hail Mary (sorry) doesn't pan out. As hard as it may be, don't take it personally and encourage your fiancé to not take it personally either. This is all about the sister and has nothing to do with you or your fiancé or your choice of a partner. So go to the wedding, enjoy it, and savor the time around people you love. Your sister will be there for other events. Above all, try not to let her absence dominate your wedding experience. Her absence is unfortunate, but it's one of those things that happens in life that one just has to deal with. I wish you and your fiance many years of happiness and a beautiful wedding.

QUESTION: I'm on the autism spectrum and my partner is also neurodivergent, albeit differently. This has been a source of connection, but also a source of struggle. For example, they frequently express frustration when I'm not reading their social cues in the way that they expect me to. They also get irritated if I leave the room because they're cooking a certain thing, or if I'm focusing on obsessive interest, as we autists are known for. I do try to communicate my needs to them, and they seem receptive to it. But often it seems like we're getting nowhere. Our brains are wired too differently. Any recommendations on how to bridge the gap?

ANSWER: This is a common problem in neurologically mixed relationships. Even with both partners being neurodivergent, being neurodivergent in different ways is often just as challenging as one partner being neurodivergent and the other neurotypical. But you're not alone in this struggle. If you aren't doing it already, I would highly recommend couples counseling. This should help you begin to work through some of these issues. There are many compromises that you can make that would be worthwhile. For instance, your partner agrees not to cook certain food with you around, or you agree to set aside a certain amount of time for them each day so that you don't get sucked into your strong interest as much. The keys are: compassion, empathy, and a willingness to listen.

There's also a growing pool of resources for couples in your situation. In particular, I would recommend that you both read the book "The Autism Partner Handbook: How to Love an Autistic Person" by Elly Blue, Faith G. Harper, and Joe Biel. It's a quick read and offers a lot of useful suggestions for your situation. Navigating neurodivergence is a challenge, but many other couples have done it. Good luck.

QUESTION: My partner and I are both liberal, but most of my family is strongly conservative, as in hardcore Trump-loving conservative. As you can imagine, we've had our share of disagreements, but we've found ways to agree to disagree. We just try not to discuss politics, and we have a rule to never talk to each other on the day of a major election, like the midterms or a presidential election. This has worked reasonably well for us and has managed to keep us in relatively close contact.

The problem is that my partner, who's an outspoken activist in our local Democratic Party, refuses to come to family events. He came to our Easter celebration one year and was visibly upset by some of the things my parents said about Trump and immigrants. Even though I 100% agree with my partner that those things were wrong, it's still important for me to spend time with my family. Lately, my partner will make excuses for not coming to family events. He'll say he's too tired or he'll say that it's too long of a drive (they live 3 hours away, but my husband routinely makes drives longer than that for work and to go to his video game conventions.) 

My family has asked why he's not coming, and I have to fudge it or come up with half-true excuses. They're smart people, and they've started to suspect the real reason for his not coming. I've tried to talk to him about it, but again he's always evasive. Should I sit down with him and ask him point-blank to please tell me the truth so we can clear the air? Or should I respect his opinions as a fellow adult and just drop the matter?

ANSWER: This is a difficult situation, I'm sorry. On the surface, I feel for your partner, as I have similar political opinions to the two of you. I still get roiled up when I hear certain types of remarks, even after 10 years of Donald Trump being in the national political spotlight. But I still think your partner is being a bit of a coward. He won't admit what's plainly obvious to you and what your family is starting to catch on to. It's fine to have differing opinions, but one shouldn't tell half-truths or be evasive when it comes to the reason for not seeing their significant other's family. At this point, this is starting to cost you time with people you love, and that's not okay. So, what I would do is sit down with him and have the conversation that you propose. Tell him you know the real reason he's avoiding them. And that it's deceitful and insulting to your intelligence for him to not admit that. And then tell him that you want to be around your family more than he's allowing you to be (assuming that's true). Ask him to reconsider his boycott of your family if only for your sake. You might want to reassure him about how you have found ways of accommodating political differences with your family, and tell him that he can use similar strategies with them to do the same. (And if your family is anything like conservative (and liberal) relatives that I know, they will care more about his character and how he treats you than how he votes at the ballot box.) Right now, frankly, his actions don't reflect well on his character.

If he still won't be accommodating to you after having a frank and honest discussion with him and laying out what I just said and anything else that you feel to be important, then honestly, I'd reconsider your choice of a partner. You don't want to be around somebody who's not willing to experience discomfort for the sake of their partner or to defend their beliefs in the presence of people who disagree with them. Because if you go on to marry this person or have a lifelong partnership with them outside of marriage, what would you be signing up for? Do you want decades with someone who won't stand up for you or defend what he believes in when challenged?

QUESTION: I'm going through a nasty divorce. My husband and I were married for about 20 years, and the marriage unraveled for a variety of reasons. Yes, there was infidelity, but that honestly wasn't the biggest part of it. The infidelity was really a symptom rather than a cause of what broke us up. Effectively, we just weren't communicating well, and we realized that we would be happier with other people.

The specific problem that I am writing to you about is our families' very different opinions about divorce and their impacts on me. Not to be stereotypical, but my family is from the West Coast, and they have a more relaxed attitude towards things like divorce. Obviously they don't like divorce, but they accept that it's sometimes necessary when a marriage has run its course or otherwise is damaged beyond repair. They're being very compassionate and graceful towards me and even towards him. My soon-to-be ex-husband's family, on the other hand, is much more religious and conservative. They feel that divorce is a sin and that he must stay in the marriage at all costs. Perhaps owing to the fact that their religious tradition is more than a little patriarchal, they've been venting most of their anger on me rather than him. Even though he's the one who cheated. They've been making snide remarks towards me about how I didn't cut it as a wife and mother. And they even called me a few times and half cajoled me, half insulted me into trying to reconsider ending the marriage.

Now I know that after the divorce, I will have less reason to interact with them. But the fact that I have three children with my husband means that they won't be out of our lives entirely. At least until the kids grow up. And that's assuming the children decide to cut ties with them, which is unlikely because our daughter in particular is close to one of her uncles and those cousins. Obviously, once our children become adults, they'll have every right to make their own independent decisions on whether to maintain ties with these soon-to-be former relatives. But I fear that keeping these relatives in our lives for the children's sake is just going to mean that the insults and other poor behavior will continue. How can I respect my children's wishes to choose their own relationship with their in-laws while protecting myself from their vitriol?

ANSWER: This is a dilemma for sure, but like many relationship dilemmas, the imperfect but necessary solution is to create boundaries. You can't control how these soon-to-be former in-laws view you or your husband or the institution of marriage. But you can control, wherever possible, how far they can be in your lives. One suggestion is to try to have a conversation with them to clear the air and push for better treatment. Discuss how hurt you feel by their remarks and say that, while you disagree with them on the divorce, it's your and your husband's right as adults to choose whether or not to stay in the marriage. Maybe even invoke some Christian teachings to try to get them to rediscover their compassionate side around you.

But if this doesn't work, and my spidey sense thinks that it won't, your only real option is to set strict boundaries with them. For instance, make it a rule that you will never talk to them unless it pertains to your children. And while your children are still minors (I presume they still are due to the context of this letter), try to arrange meetings between them and those relatives where you have minimal contact. If possible, ask your ex-husband if he can attend these meetings without you. Remember that you don't owe anybody anything except for your children, and to the extent required by law and common ethics, your husband as well. (For example, he will presumably be entitled to some amount of custody as the father of the children, unless he's a true monster.) And even while your kids are still minors, you don't have to agree to a Christmas or Thanksgiving or anything else with these in-laws. Those expectations collapsed when the marriage did. You can limit your interaction with them to the extent necessary to facilitate periodic visits between them and your children. And after these children become adults, they can conduct their completely autonomous relationships with these relatives if they so choose, without you having to be involved at all. Good luck and chin up. It will get better.

QUESTION: I'm a 37-year-old man, and I live with my long-term partner. No kids. My brother and I are not close. He lives just a 3-hour drive away, and we routinely make drives longer than that for various reasons, but we only see him maybe once every couple of years. And this includes Christmases and Thanksgivings. We are not actively hostile. We get along relatively well, and we have a few things in common. But we really are at the level of at most casual friends. I have co-workers who I'm closer to than my brother. I want to reconcile with him, but I really don't know how. Do you have any strategies for trying to connect with a semi-estranged but not hostile sibling?

ANSWER: It's hard to know exactly what advice to provide, given the limited context I have here. For instance: what are the reasons for the estrangement? Was there a sibling rivalry growing up, such as competition over grades or sports? Did you two fight a lot as children?

The general advice on family estrangement is that it's heavily context-specific. In the most extreme cases, such as abuse, the right and reasonable course of action is to cut off contact to the extent possible. But it doesn't sound from your letter like this is the case. In less extreme situations, it really depends a lot on the reasons for the estrangement and knowing the other person, how you think they would react. In these less extreme situations, it's usually a good idea to reach out directly to the person and try to clear the air. This doesn't necessarily need to involve a tell-all or a play-by-play recounting of what happened in the past between you. It could just be something along the lines of: "Hey [Brother], I'm sure you've noticed we don't talk very often and I'd like to change that. I value you as a sibling and love you and hope we can have a good relationship. What do you think about that?" 

That conveys that you've taken the initiative to try to improve the situation, and that then puts the ball in his court. Ultimately, it will depend on how he responds as to whether or not you two can have a closer relationship. You will have done your part by starting the conversation just mentioned. Another thing I would suggest is to try to meet him at his place rather than the reverse. You can make that 3-hour drive as an additional gesture of your goodwill. Obviously with some advance notice, however. Good luck.

QUESTION: My daughter just came out to my husband and me. It happened relatively undramatically. We were all sitting around the kitchen table, eating dinner, and she mentioned that she had something to tell us. She said that her friend, who we will call Chloe, is actually her girlfriend, and that she's been pretty sure that she is gay for some time. She's 16. She says that while she's been attracted to other girls aside from Chloe, Chloe is the first one to actually reciprocate. And she says she's never been attracted to any boys.

My husband and I paused for a moment, not out of disapproval, but because we simply didn't know how to respond. Finally, we both said something about how we love her and that she's glad and that we're glad that she has enough trust in us to confide in us about this. Neither my husband nor I are homophobic. We have both long supported gay rights, and we've both been close to people who are gay. My husband even bought a small pride flag for her room. The problem though is how do we go about actually relating to her? While my husband and I are honestly elated that we won't have to deal with any teen pregnancy scares, we're also unsure about how we as straight people can truly relate to her experiences. We know that, when it comes to dating and relationships, gay and straight people have many things in common, more so than what divides them. But being gay in our still substantially homophobic society is an experience that neither my husband and I have ever known firsthand. Do you have any suggestions or resources on how to connect with her on this?

ANSWER: About three-quarters of the battle has already been won. She is very lucky to have such loving and supportive parents. Sadly, many people in her situation don't. When it comes to the question of how to relate to her better, you can start the conversation with what you mentioned to me: that there are many similarities between what people experience in gay relationships and what they experience in straight ones. The giddiness and euphoria of a first love, the experience of heartbreak, rejection, hope, physical and emotional intimacy-- these experiences are universal and don't conform to sexual labels. You can probably relate a great deal to what she's going through if you had a relationship or a crush at her age.

And as far as the experiences that don't overlap between straight and gay people, compassion and proactivity is the name of the game. Reinform your unconditional love and support for her and for her choice of partner, whoever that may be. Be proactive without being overbearing. Initiate some of these conversations and discussions, while also knowing when to hang back. And above all, just be there for her. Gay or straight, teenagers need to have that affirmation from parents. With parents also granting them more autonomy, assuming that their behavior and maturity justify it. And yes, by all means, celebrate that when she goes out with her girlfriend, there's not the risk of a pregnancy involved. And remember that even though she still needs guardrails, as all under-18s do, she's also on the cusp of adulthood and is experiencing a situation that's novel for her. Be there with love, compassion, and common sense, offering advice when needed, but generally leaving her to have her own experiences and make her own mistakes. This is the best way to equip her to navigate not only her current relationship but all the ones that follow.

QUESTION: I'm 28 years old (female), and my boyfriend is 33. We get along well and he's a great guy, loves me, loves my dog, wants kids, is usually pretty low maintenance. The problem is, well, I suppose a common one. It's a new time and in many cases, women are working and earning more than men. We are a textbook example of this. Although in our case, I am the only one earning anything at all! I just finished grad school last year and I have a really good, promising job in the finance industry. Nothing like those Wolf of Wall Street financiers but still a good, sustainable job. My boyfriend, by contrast, has always been a bit of a dreamer. He dropped out of college once, then finished a couple years later after volunteering in several cities in America and earning very little money. I met him during his second college stint when I was finishing up college myself. We had a period of long distance but long story short, decided it was worth it, stuck out the long distance, and then started living together after he was able to move back to our town. He also got a master's degree somewhere along the way but isn't using it. He says he wants to change the world and has big plans to end world hunger and improve global education.

Part of why I fell in love with him was that idealism. But honestly, the situation is starting to become untenable. As I mentioned, he doesn't work right now. He's in a volunteer gig and he sometimes picks up shifts as an Uber driver. But that's hardly what he went to grad school to do. When I urge him to help pay at least a respectable portion of the rent, he keeps talking to me about how his dreams are so important and how so many people in third-world countries are living so much worse than us. So you shouldn't be complaining. I get and understand that there are lots of people who have it worse off than us. But that's still no excuse in my view for what he's doing. As I alluded to earlier, I'm interested in starting a family soon, but can't imagine doing it with him until he does a 180 with his life. And when I have mentioned kids around him, he seems at best ambivalent. What should I do? Stay or go?

ANSWER: I think you've probably answered your own question. You tell me that you've talked to him about the problem, but he blows you off talking about his big dreams. And it seems like he's been like this for some time based on your letter. So, honestly, your lifestyles and what you want in the future just aren't compatible. You have a promising career. He seems to just want to follow his dreams by not working. And you've said that he "seems at best ambivalent" about having children, which you say is one of your big goals. And at 28, you're probably aware that you won't have forever to make this happen. 

You've invested a number of years in this man, and I have no doubt that there's lots of love between you. Any breakup would be devastating, but would breaking up with him be any more devastating than forgoing your wish to have children to accommodate someone who has had years to start to build a gainful career but apparently hasn't done so? And even with your well-paying job, I imagine that the stress of having to support him, and yourself, is starting to get to you. My younger sister had a boyfriend much like him. Sweet guy, really loved her, great with her dog. But he just wouldn't get his life together. He was working a dead-end job and he made no meaningful efforts to try to better his situation, either by going back to school or by looking for another job. My sister made the heartbreaking but necessary decision to end it with him. You seem to be in a very similar situation. So unless there is something big that you haven't told me about in this letter that would change this situation, I would urge you to likewise end this relationship and look for someone who is going to pull his weight in a relationship, and eventually as a father. I know it's always very hurtful to end a relationship, but I think that you, as my sister did, will look back on this breakup and realize that although it hurt, you did the right thing for both of you.

QUESTION: I'm 27 and my boyfriend is 30; we've been together for three years and living together for 1.5 years. We get along well and are managing financially, but the problem is with his parents. They're in their late 60s, living on limited income (his father is retired from the military, his mother was a teacher until she quit due to osteoarthritis), but despite their modest pensions, they've made extremely inadvisable financial decisions—luxury cruises, expensive restaurants they can't afford. They're emotionally manipulative, constantly playing on the fact that he's their only child to get him to spend money on them and go into debt. He can't seem to resist, and I think part of it is his sense of duty carried over from when he was in the military—he feels he owes his parents for raising him and wants to give back. They're taking advantage of this. I've tried talking to him about this multiple times, but he always says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else. I love him and don't want to leave, but I also don't want us to go broke because he can't say no to his parents. Is there any hope for us?

ANSWER: "He always just says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else." I think that tells you everything you need to know. I don't doubt that he loves you and that his sense of duty also includes a commitment to you. He sounds like a noble person, but people with a strong sense of duty can be vulnerable to manipulation, as you've seen. In this predicament with his parents, you've asked him multiple times to reconsider his supporting and enabling them, but he isn't responsive to that. And he doesn't seem to respect your input or try to seek any sort of compromise with respect to the money that he spends and the debt that he goes into for them.

This shouldn't remain your problem. You've done your best and made your feelings known to him, but he's ignored them repeatedly. Sadly, I think the best choice that you have is to end the relationship and start over. You don't want to become a second enabler for his parents. Nor do you want his consistent choosing of his parents over you to wreck your own credit and damage your own financial future.

QUESTION: My wife started seeing a therapist about a year ago after her mother died, which I fully supported. But now our marriage is falling apart because of it. When we have disagreements, she comes home from her sessions and immediately brings up whatever we're fighting about, but now she says things like "My therapist says you should..." or "My therapist says I need to..." and then she becomes completely inflexible, treating her therapist's advice like it's a binding court ruling. I feel like I'm being ganged up on by two people, and I can't even defend myself because I'm not in the room with them. I've asked to join a session or see a couples counselor together, but she says her therapist recommended a different therapist for couples work, and I'm resistant because these therapists are expensive and I don't want to cede control of our marriage to them. We're now talking about separating, which I never thought would happen. How can I save our marriage without giving up all control to therapists?

ANSWER: First, let's address the control issue directly: you're already losing your marriage, so the question isn't whether to involve professionals, but which professionals and how. Your wife's individual therapist is correct that couples counseling requires a different therapist—that's standard practice, not a power play. The individual therapist's job is to support your wife's growth, not to referee your marriage. That's why couples work needs its own neutral space.

The real issue here is that you're hearing your wife's version of what happens in therapy, not what actually happens. Therapists don't typically say "You should do X" or "Your spouse needs to Y"—they help people explore their feelings and needs. Your wife may be misrepresenting what's being said, or she may be taking the therapist's guidance and turning it into demands. Either way, you need to be in the room to hear it for yourself. I'd strongly recommend accepting the couples counseling offer. Think of it this way: you're not ceding control to therapists, you're getting professional help to communicate better. If the cost is truly prohibitive, many therapists offer sliding scale fees, and some community health centers provide low-cost counseling. But if you're choosing between paying for therapy or paying for two separate households, the math is pretty clear. The goal isn't to have therapists run your marriage—it's to learn tools to run it better yourselves.

QUESTION: My husband has always been particular about cleanliness, but since he started a high-stress job, it's gotten much worse. When he's on his way home, I can feel my whole body tense up. I rush around cleaning counters, vacuuming, putting away dishes, making sure no toys are out—all before he walks through the door. If anything is out of place when he arrives, he immediately starts straightening and cleaning, often before even saying hello. I've adapted to his standards over the years, and we're both tidy now, but I feel like I'm living under constant pressure to keep things perfect so he doesn't spiral into cleaning mode. Our kids are experiencing the stress too, and it's getting to them. It's exhausting, and I hate that I sometimes dread his return because of the energy shift it brings. We've talked about it many times, but not much has changed. He refuses counseling and says he'll "work on it," but I don't see real progress. How can I support him without losing my peace or turning our home into a stress zone for everyone?

ANSWER: His anxious behavior is affecting your entire family. The fact that you're pre-cleaning before he gets home to avoid triggering him is a sign that his needs have expanded beyond reasonable boundaries. You can't make him get help, but you can set boundaries around how his anxiety affects you and your children. At least in the short term.

Start by having a direct conversation when you're both calm: "I love you, and I can see that your need for order is tied to managing stress from work. But when you come home and immediately start cleaning without greeting us, it makes me and the kids feel like we're less important than a clean counter. I also notice that I'm spending energy trying to prevent your reactions, which isn't sustainable for me." Then propose specific changes: he agrees to say hello and spend five minutes with the family before addressing any mess, and you agree to maintain reasonable tidiness without the pre-cleaning scramble. If he can't commit to these small changes, then you need to consider whether this is the life you want. 

And even if you can, the changes that I just proposed are just a band-aid. They can buy you some time to make your house a bit of a less stressful place while you ask your husband to reconsider his refusal to get professional help. Because in the long term, if you want to truly get this problem under control, he's going to need professional help. His refusal to get such help for what's clearly impacting his family is a choice he's making, and you don't have to accommodate it indefinitely. You might also benefit from individual therapy to help you set and maintain these boundaries without feeling guilty and to talk through what the future might look like if your husband keeps refusing to get professional help in the longer term.

QUESTION: My wife comes from a large, close-knit family, while I come from a much smaller family. Sometimes it seems like I have lived through "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." But movie references aside, this has resulted in cultural adaptations for both of us. Geography also shapes our interactions with our respective families, especially around the holidays. Her family is mostly local. Most live within an hour's driving radius. By contrast, my family is very spread out. By "spread out", I mean that I need to get on a plane to see three of my four immediate family members. And there's no destination I can go to where I will be within 200 miles of more than one of my immediate family members. As you can imagine, this means we spend most holidays with her family. It just makes logistical sense, especially because traveling over the holidays is such a nightmare. But at the same time, I feel that this is a bit inequitable. I grew up assuming that my wife and I would alternate families to visit for the holidays, as a lot of people do. For instance, we see her family for Thanksgiving, I see hers for Christmas, then do it the reverse the following year. But the distance makes this impractical. I also have limited time off from work, and we like to travel outside of the holidays for leisure purposes as well. How can we heed logistical realities while making things fairer?

ANSWER: Short of a couple or more of your family members moving, there isn't really a way to do it without working around the geography. There are a great many families that can't simply do the one-side-for-Thanksgiving/other-for-Christmas pattern that you mentioned. For instance, some relatives have limited mobility. Some relatives have much smaller houses to support family gatherings than others. And as in your situation, geography is often a major factor. So I'd say the first step for you would be to step back from the script that you've been trying to follow and recognize the diversity of experiences out there. There's no one-size-fits-all model for the holidays.

Now come the actual logistical suggestions. You may not see your family as often as you see hers, but there are still some ways to work out compromises. For instance, maybe travel every other year to see a long-distance relative around Christmas, since Christmas tends to be a little bit better than Thanksgiving for travel. You can cut down on outside-of-holidays travel in the years that you go to see your relatives. Or you can invent your own traditions. For example, you could have an early Christmas at one of your relatives' houses and arrange for other family members to fly in as well. This avoids the worst holiday travel and also gives you another celebration to look forward to. You could do the same for Thanksgiving. I have experienced both of these things, and the celebration feels just as festive as if it were on the official calendar day. These situations are challenging at first, but they are definitely workable. So go enjoy your Festivus or your Pre-Christmas. I am sure they will be as wonderful and memorable as the traditional holidays.

QUESTION: I'm expecting my first baby in a few months, and I'm struggling with a decision I never thought I'd face. I always assumed I would stay home with my kids, at least during the early years—that's how I was raised. My mom stayed home throughout our entire childhoods. But now that I'm actually pregnant, I realize I don't want to leave my job. I work in HR at a midsize company, and while the work is challenging, it's also predictable and I find it fulfilling. It also doesn't make financial sense right now because I bring in roughly 60% of our family's income—my husband is a schoolteacher. Most of my friends either don't have kids yet or are stay-at-home moms, so I don't have great models for working motherhood. My coworkers who are moms seem frazzled and complain about their kids all the time, which scares me. Is it even possible to be a happy working mom, or am I letting money make a decision for me that should be moral or emotional?

ANSWER: Yes, it's absolutely possible to be a happy working mom—millions of women do it every day. The fact that your coworkers complain doesn't mean they're unhappy; sometimes people vent about challenges without meaning they regret their choices. You might try talking to them directly: "I'm expecting and trying to figure out the work-life balance. I hear you venting sometimes—can you tell me what you actually like about working and parenting? What makes it work for you?" Their answers might surprise you.

The bigger issue here is the "should" in your question. There's no moral imperative to stay home or to work—there's only what works for your family, your finances, your personality, and your circumstances. You're bringing in most of the income, you find your work fulfilling, and you don't want to leave. Those are all valid reasons to continue working. The key is to set yourself up for success: discuss with your husband how you'll share childcare responsibilities, consider what kind of childcare arrangement would work best for your family, and be realistic about what you can and can't do. You might also find that your feelings change once the baby arrives. Some women who planned to work find they want to stay home, and some who planned to stay home find they need the structure and adult interaction that work provides. Give yourself permission to make the decision that's right for you, and know that you can always reassess as your circumstances change.

QUESTION: My husband and I recently discovered that our 17-year-old is depressed and has contemplated suicide. I found out by going through their phone after noticing they seemed "off" and didn't want to talk to me. Our teen feels betrayed and angry that I went through their phone. We took them to their pediatrician for an evaluation, and they refused to talk at all or to consider antidepressant or nonmedical interventions. We went to a therapist twice and they refused to speak at all. I've tried drawing them out, waiting patiently, explaining how suicide cannot be undone and we will get through this together, but nothing seems to get through. They did confirm that there was no event that triggered this—they're just sad. They said talking to their friends helps. But I don't know what to do. I'm barely sleeping and every time they're out of sight I'm wondering if they're okay. I asked if they'd see a different therapist and got completely shut down. How do we continue in this liminal space where our teen is suffering but refusing help?

ANSWER: This is terrifying, and I'm so sorry your family is going through this. The most important thing right now is that you and your husband get professional support for yourselves, even if your teen won't. Find a therapist who specializes in adolescent mental health—not to “fix” your teen, but to guide you on how to support them. This is one of those situations where you need expert instructions, not just well-meaning advice.

Since your teen won't talk to a therapist, you need to be their support system. Keep doing what you're doing: spending time with them, doing things they enjoy, taking them outside for walks even if there's resistance. But also, get eyes on them at school—talk to the school counselor confidentially about your concerns. Make sure any firearms are completely removed from your home (not just locked up), and ask friends and family to do the same if your teen visits. The phone issue is tricky—you violated their privacy, which they're rightfully upset about, but you also found critical information. You might need to apologize for the method while explaining why you were worried: "I'm sorry I went through your phone. I was scared because you seemed so different, and I didn't know how else to understand what was happening. Can we find a better way for you to let me know when you're struggling?" Most importantly, keep the lines of communication open. They said talking to friends helps—that's actually a good sign. Don't try to replace that, but do make sure they know you're available whenever they're ready to talk. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and you need to take care of yourself too so you can be there for the long haul.

QUESTION: I'm getting married next year and I want to wear my grandmother's wedding gown. She got married in 1970 and her dress is a stunning floor-length fuchsia A-line gown with a square neckline—she hated white as much as I do. My grandmother is having it dry cleaned and says it's still in perfect condition. My future mother-in-law thought it was wonderful that I'd be wearing my grandmother's gown until she saw a picture of it. Now she insists that it couldn't be a wedding gown since brides only wore white back then, even though the picture is clearly of my grandparents on their wedding day. She can't let it go and keeps saying what a mistake it will be to be married in "that dreary old pink dress" and that I'll miss the fun of picking my own special gown. My mom also suggested I wear something more traditional like she did, and offered me her white gown, but I hate it—it's poufy and over the top with tulle and beading. My fiancé says I should wear what makes me happy, which is my grandmother's dress. With both moms objecting, is this a stupid hill to die on?

ANSWER: No, this is not a stupid hill to die on. It's your wedding, and you should wear what makes you happy. Your future mother-in-law is wrong about historical wedding dress colors—plenty of brides wore colors other than white throughout history, and even in 1970, non-white wedding dresses weren't unheard of. But more importantly, her opinion about what you should wear on your wedding day is just that—an opinion, not a requirement.

Here's what I'd suggest: thank both mothers for their input, then firmly close the topic. "Thanks for everyone's thoughts, but I've decided to wear my grandmother's dress. The topic's closed." Mean it, and don't engage in further discussion about it. If they bring it up again, you can say, "We've already discussed this, and my decision is made." Your fiancé is right to support you, and it's good that he's on your side. If your future mother-in-law continues to push, he should be the one to tell her to stop, since it's his family. This is actually a good test of how you'll handle future boundary issues with your in-laws. If you give in on something as personal as your wedding dress to avoid conflict, you're setting a pattern of letting them dictate your choices. Start as you mean to go on: with respect for their opinions, but with firm boundaries about what's yours to decide. Wear the pink dress, and have a beautiful wedding.

QUESTION: My brother and I have always been very competitive. We were raised in a household where academic success was valued above almost everything else. He and I were both very good students, but he was the better one. In particular, I struggled at math. But he always aced his math classes and now has a math PhD and one in physics. I have, "only," a single PhD in a non-math related field. Our competition dynamic led to a distant relationship that we have had during our entire adult lives. We're both in our early forties. I want to try to mend the rift, but I'm not sure where to begin. This is complicated by the fact that on the relatively rare occasions that we see each other, the old competitive dynamic emerges again. For instance, recently when we were visiting our mother, we played games such as Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble in which he smoked me. He's never been a jerk or bragged about beating me in things, but I still feel the effects of it. How can we move towards a more productive dynamic?

ANSWER: Sibling rivalries are always difficult, and while your relationship is generally cordial, the competitive dynamic from your past complicates it. I admire your willingness to reach out. Start by having an initial conversation with him to break the ice and build a better relationship—in this first conversation, don't mention the competitive dynamic unless it comes up. Just focus on the fact that you've been distant and that you want to be more a part of his life. He should be receptive to that unless he has some sort of secret grudge against you.

Regardless of how he responds, it's important for you to do some work on yourself to question this mentality of competition, ideally with a therapist. Try to understand not just where this idea of competition comes from, but how it affects you now: does it add to your life or take away from it? I would also urge you to cultivate hobbies and interests that don't depend on competition, such as gardening, art, or single-player video games. And stay away from social media, which amplifies the "keeping up with the Joneses" dynamic. With some healthy new hobbies and ways of thinking, you'll be well on your way to better managing this relationship and, equally importantly, your own mental health.

QUESTION: My girlfriend and I have been dating for two years, and we're both in our late 20s. I've always known I wanted kids—it's been a life goal of mine for as long as I can remember. When we first started dating, she said she wasn't sure about kids, which I thought meant she was open to the possibility. But recently, she's been more firm about it, saying she doesn't think she wants children and that she's pretty certain about that. I love her and I can see a future with her, but I can't imagine my life without being a parent. I've tried to talk to her about it, but she gets defensive and says I'm pressuring her. I don't want to pressure her, but I also don't want to waste either of our time if we're fundamentally incompatible on this. How do we navigate this?

ANSWER: This is one of those fundamental incompatibilities that can't be compromised on—you can't have half a kid, and one person shouldn't have to sacrifice such a major life goal for the other. The fact that she's getting defensive suggests she knows this is a deal-breaker issue, and she may be trying to avoid the conversation because she doesn't want to face what it might mean for your relationship.

You need to have one more direct, honest conversation. Frame it not as pressure, but as clarity: "I love you, and I want to build a future with you. But I need to know where you stand on kids, because this is a deal-breaker for me. I'm not asking you to change your mind—I'm asking you to be honest with me and with yourself about what you want." Give her space to think about it, but set a timeline. If after some reflection she's certain she doesn't want kids, then you have your answer. It's heartbreaking, but staying together when you want fundamentally different things will only lead to resentment—either you'll resent her for "depriving" you of parenthood, or she'll resent you if she has a child she doesn't want. Neither outcome is fair to either of you, or to a potential child. The kindest thing you can do for both of you is to be honest about this incompatibility and make the hard decision to part ways if you can't align on this fundamental life goal.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been in a long-distance relationship for the past year. We met online and hit it off immediately, and we've been making it work with visits every few months. But lately, I'm starting to feel like the distance is taking a toll. We talk on the phone and video chat regularly, but it's not the same as being together. I'm starting to feel lonely and disconnected, and I'm wondering if I'm missing out on opportunities to meet someone local. We've talked about one of us moving, but neither of us can right now—I'm in grad school and they're established in their career. I love them, but I'm not sure how much longer I can do this. How do I know if the distance is just a temporary challenge we can overcome, or if it's a sign that this isn't meant to be?

ANSWER: Long-distance relationships can work, but they require a clear end date or at least a concrete plan for when you'll be together. The fact that neither of you can move right now is understandable, but "someday" isn't a plan; it's a hope. You need to sit down together and have a serious conversation about timelines: when could one of you realistically move? What would that look like? What are you both willing to sacrifice to make it happen? If the answer is "we don't know" or "maybe in a few years," then you're essentially asking yourself to put your life on hold indefinitely, which isn't fair to either of you.

The loneliness you're feeling is valid, and it's worth examining whether you're staying in this relationship because you genuinely see a future together, or because you're afraid of being alone or of hurting them. Ask yourself: if you knew for certain that you'd be long-distance for another three years with no clear plan to close the distance, would you stay? If the answer is no, you have your answer. It's okay to love someone and still recognize that the circumstances aren't right for you. That doesn't make the love less real—it just means that love alone isn't always enough to make a relationship work. You deserve to be in a relationship that meets your needs, including the need for physical presence and daily connection. If this relationship can't provide that within a reasonable timeframe, it may be time to have an honest conversation about whether the sacrifices that each of you are making are truly worth it.

QUESTION: I've been dating my boyfriend for about six months, and things are going well overall. But there's one issue that's been bothering me: he's still very close with his ex-girlfriend. They text regularly, hang out one-on-one, and he even invited her to a party at his place recently. When I asked him about it, he said they're just friends and that their relationship was never that serious anyway. I trust him, but it still makes me uncomfortable. I've never stayed friends with my exes, so I don't really understand how that works. Am I being unreasonable? Should I ask him to cut back on the friendship, or is this something I need to work on?

ANSWER: Whether exes can be friends is highly individual—some people can maintain healthy platonic friendships with former partners, and others can't. The question isn't whether it's "normal" to be friends with an ex, but whether this particular friendship is appropriate and respectful of your current relationship. There are some red flags here: the one-on-one hangouts, the regular texting, and the fact that he's including her in his social life in a way that might be making you feel like a third wheel.

Before you ask him to change anything, you need to understand what's really going on. Have a calm conversation: "I trust you, but I'm feeling uncomfortable with how close you are with your ex. Can you help me understand the friendship? What does it look like from your perspective?" Pay attention to his response. Does he dismiss your feelings? Does he get defensive? Or does he listen and try to help you understand? A partner who cares about your feelings will want to address your discomfort, even if they don't agree that there's a problem. You might find that there are reasonable boundaries you can both agree on—maybe group hangouts are fine, but one-on-one dinners feel too intimate. Or maybe you can all hang out together so you can see their dynamic for yourself. But if he's unwilling to make any adjustments or if his friendship with his ex is more important than your comfort in the relationship, that tells you something about his priorities. You're not being unreasonable to want boundaries around ex-relationships—that's a very common need in romantic partnerships.

QUESTION: My husband and I have been married five years and we have two young children. My husband's job requires him to travel frequently—he's gone about two weeks out of every month. When he's home, he's often exhausted and wants to relax, which means I'm still doing most of the childcare and household management even when he's here. I work full-time too, and I'm burning out. I've tried talking to him about it, but he says his job is demanding and he needs downtime when he's home. I understand that, but I also need a break, and I feel like I'm doing everything alone. We can't afford for him to change jobs right now, but something has to give. How do we find balance when his career requires so much travel?

ANSWER: This is a really tough situation, and your burnout is completely understandable. The issue isn't just the travel—it's that when he's home, the division of labor isn't fair. Yes, he's tired from work, but so are you, and you've been holding down the fort solo while he's been away. His "downtime" shouldn't come at the expense of you never getting any.

You need to have a serious conversation about restructuring how things work when he's home. Start by acknowledging his need for rest, but also make it clear that you have the same need: "I know you're exhausted when you get home, and I want you to have time to recharge. But I've been working and parenting solo while you're gone, and I'm exhausted too. We need to find a way for both of us to get breaks." Then get specific: maybe he takes the kids for a few hours on Saturday morning so you can sleep in or have time to yourself. Maybe you alternate who handles bedtime routines. Maybe you hire help—a babysitter for a few hours a week, or a cleaning service to take some of the household burden off both of you. The key is that his travel schedule can't be an excuse for you to carry 100% of the load when he's home. That's not sustainable, and it will breed resentment.

You also need to talk about the long-term plan. If his job requires this much travel indefinitely, you both need to decide if that's the life you want. Can he seek another role in the same company that requires less travel? Can you make financial changes that would allow him to take a job with less travel, even if it pays less? The current arrangement might work short-term, but if it's going to be years of this, you need to know that and make an informed decision about whether you can handle it. Your mental health and your children's well-being depend on you not being constantly overwhelmed.

QUESTION: My girlfriend and I have been together for a year, and we're both in our early 30s. She's great in so many ways, but there's one thing that's really bothering me: she's constantly on her phone when we're together. We'll be having dinner, and she'll be scrolling through social media. We'll be watching a movie, and she'll be texting. Even when we're having what I think is an important conversation, she'll pick up her phone to check notifications. I've mentioned it a few times, and she'll put it away for a little while, but then she's right back to it. I feel like I'm competing with her phone for attention, and it's making me feel unimportant. Am I overreacting, or is this a legitimate concern?

ANSWER: You're not overreacting—this is a legitimate concern. When someone is constantly on their phone during shared time, it sends a message that whatever's on the screen is more important than the person in front of them. That's hurtful, and it's reasonable to want your partner's full attention when you're spending time together.

The fact that she puts it away temporarily when you mention it but then goes back to it suggests this might be more of a habit or compulsion than intentional disregard. Some people genuinely struggle with phone addiction or use their phones as a way to manage anxiety or boredom. But regardless of the reason, it's affecting your relationship, and that needs to be addressed.

Have a direct conversation when you're both calm and not in the middle of a phone-checking moment: "I love spending time with you, but I've noticed that you're often on your phone when we're together, and it makes me feel like I'm not important to you. I'd like us to have some phone-free time together—maybe during meals, or when we're watching something, or having important conversations. Can we agree on some boundaries around that?" Be specific about what you need. Maybe phones go in another room during dinner, or you have certain times that are designated as phone-free. If she's resistant or dismissive of your feelings, that's a bigger problem. But if she's willing to work on it, you might need to help her by suggesting alternatives—maybe she needs to address underlying anxiety, or maybe your time together needs to be made more engaging so she's less tempted to reach for her phone. The goal is to find a balance where you both feel present and connected.

As a coda, I will add that there are also apps out there that limit access to distracting apps. These apps allow someone to set restrictions around the use of distracting apps (such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, or any apps one chooses). These are often time-based (e.g., during working hours or during the evenings) but can also have settings such as limiting the amount of time someone can open such apps in a day. One of the best of these is called Opal. Such an app might also be a solution if, as you mentioned, her heavy phone use is more of an unconscious habit than a conscious effort to avoid talking to you. I'd recommend looking into these apps.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for three years, and we're talking about getting engaged. The problem is my family. They're very traditional and have made it clear they don't approve of my partner for several reasons—my partner is from a different cultural background, has a different religion, and my family thinks they're "not good enough" for me. We've tried to include my partner in family events, but my family is cold and sometimes outright rude. My partner has been incredibly patient and understanding, but I can see it's taking a toll. I love my family, but I also love my partner, and I'm tired of being caught in the middle. How do I handle this?

ANSWER: This is a painful situation, and I'm sorry you're dealing with it. The reality is that you can't control your family's behavior, but you can control how you respond to it and what you're willing to tolerate. Right now, by continuing to bring your partner into situations where they're treated poorly, you're essentially condoning that treatment, even if that's not your intention.

You must set clear boundaries with your family. Have a direct conversation: "I love you all, and I want you in my life. But the way you're treating my partner is unacceptable, and I won't continue to subject them to that. If you can't be respectful and welcoming to my partner, then I won't be bringing them to family events, and I may need to limit my own participation as well." This is hard, but necessary. Your partner deserves to be treated with basic respect, and you deserve to not have to choose between your family and your relationship.

The key is to be consistent. If you set this boundary but then keep showing up to family events without your partner, or if you let your family's comments slide, you're sending mixed messages. You might also consider whether there are family members who are more accepting—maybe you can maintain relationships with those individuals separately, while limiting contact with those who are hostile. Ultimately, if your family can't accept your partner, that's their loss. You're building a life with someone you love, and that's what matters. Your family can either be part of that life on respectful terms, or they can choose not to be. But you shouldn't have to sacrifice your relationship to maintain a relationship with people who don't respect your choices.

QUESTION: I'm the mother of two kids, a son age 15 and a daughter age 13. My son has expressed a strong interest in being a physician, a goal that I support because he has a genuine love for medicine—he's been interested in it from a very young age and has loved his hospital shadowing experiences. The problem is that he's so focused on school and grades that he isn't doing any extracurriculars. I worry that now that he's in high school, not having extracurriculars will hurt his chances of getting into a good college and eventually medical school, even if he maintains his excellent grades. I don't like the "extracurricular arms race" that high school has become, but I recognize we have to work within the system as it exists. I've repeatedly encouraged him to find an extracurricular he likes, even suggesting the Science Club since science is his favorite subject, but he always says he's focused on schoolwork and that Science Club would be redundant since he already studies science outside of school. I want him to forge his own path, but I also don't want him to make choices that could hurt his chances of getting into medical school or another professional or graduate school. How can I strike a balance between providing sound parental advice and giving him the autonomy he needs to make his own choices?

ANSWER: I agree with you about the extracurricular arms race—it's unfortunate that these activities have become boxes to check rather than enriching experiences, but you're right that we need to work within the system. A good first step is to talk to his guidance counselor (and encourage him to do the same) to understand what extracurricular portfolios look like for recent graduates who got into good colleges; you can also talk to other parents and look at reputable websites (avoid sources like U.S. News and World Report, which exaggerate prestige factors). Being armed with facts helps reduce over-worrying. I would stress that having one or two extracurriculars can be important for college admissions—it's not fair, but that's how the system works. My brother had virtually perfect grades and a 1600 SAT score yet didn't get into Yale, and we think his lack of extracurriculars was a major factor. Does your son have friends in extracurriculars who've had good experiences? Does he have interests outside of science that could be pursued in an extracurricular? Most schools offer many options, and even if his doesn't, there should be something that appeals to his interests. Remind him that these organizations are good ways to make friends and can be enriching beyond just a line on a resume. Good luck—he sounds like a really good kid.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I are both 25, and we've been dating for about eight months. Things are going well, but there's one issue: he wants to move in together, and I'm not ready. I like having my own space, and I'm not sure we've been together long enough to take that step. When I tell him this, he gets hurt and says it makes him feel like I don't see a future with us. I do see a future with us, but I also think moving in together is a big step that shouldn't be rushed. How do I explain this without making him feel rejected?

ANSWER: Your instinct to take things slowly is valid—eight months isn't very long, and moving in together is a significant commitment that changes the dynamic of a relationship. His hurt feelings are understandable, but they shouldn't pressure you into making a decision you're not ready for. Moving in together before you're ready is a recipe for resentment and conflict.

Have a conversation that acknowledges his feelings while being clear about your own: "I understand why this feels like rejection, and that's not my intention at all. I do see a future with us, which is why I want to make sure we're making this decision for the right reasons and at the right time. Moving in together is a big step, and I want us to be in a place where we're both excited about it, not where one of us is doing it to avoid hurting the other's feelings." Then talk about what "ready" looks like for you: maybe you want to hit the one-year mark, or maybe you want to work through some other issues first, or maybe you just need more time to feel comfortable with the idea. Be specific about your timeline if you have one, or be honest if you don't know when you'll be ready.

It's also worth exploring why he's pushing for this so soon. Is he insecure about the relationship? Is there a financial reason? Understanding his motivation can help you address the underlying concern. But ultimately, if you're not ready, you're not ready, and that's okay. A partner who truly cares about you will respect your boundaries and timeline, even if it's not what they hoped for. If he can't accept that and continues to pressure you, that's a red flag about how he handles not getting his way in the relationship.

QUESTION: My wife and I have been married for eight years, and we have a good relationship overall. But there's one recurring issue: she's very close with her group of college friends, and they have a group chat where they're constantly messaging. The problem is that they often share very personal details about their lives, including things about their relationships and sex lives. My wife participates in these conversations and sometimes shares details about our relationship that I'm not comfortable with. When I've asked her to keep our private life private, she says I'm being too sensitive and that this is just how her friend group communicates. But I feel like my privacy is being violated, and I don't want our intimate details discussed in a group chat. How do we resolve this?

ANSWER: Your feelings are completely valid—you have a right to privacy in your relationship, and your wife sharing intimate details about your life without your consent is a boundary violation. The fact that she's dismissing your concerns as being "too sensitive" is also problematic. Your comfort level matters, and a good partner should respect that, even if they don't fully understand it.

You need to have a clear conversation about boundaries: "I understand that your friend group is close and shares a lot with each other. But when you share details about our relationship, especially intimate ones, it makes me feel like my privacy isn't being respected. I'm not asking you to stop being close with your friends, but I am asking you to keep our private life private. Can we agree on what's off-limits?" Be specific about what you consider private—maybe it's anything about your sex life, or maybe it's details about arguments or personal struggles. The key is that you both need to agree on what's okay to share and what isn't.

If she continues to dismiss your concerns or refuses to change her behavior, that's a bigger issue. It suggests she doesn't respect your boundaries or your right to privacy. You might need to consider couples counseling to work through this, because trust and respect for boundaries are fundamental to a healthy relationship. Your wife's friendships are important, but they shouldn't come at the expense of your comfort and privacy in your own marriage.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for two years. We get along great and have similar values and goals. But there's one thing that's been bothering me: there's a 12-year age gap between us—I'm 35 and they're 23. When we started dating, the age difference didn't seem like a big deal, but lately I've been thinking about it more. I'm at a point where I'm thinking about settling down, buying a house, maybe having kids. They're still figuring out their career, want to travel, and aren't sure about kids. I'm worried that we're at different life stages, and that might cause problems down the road. Am I overthinking this, or are these legitimate concerns?

ANSWER: These are legitimate concerns. Age gaps can work in relationships, but they often come with life-stage differences that can pose challenges. The fact that you're thinking about settling down and they're still in the exploration phase is a real difference that needs to be addressed, not dismissed.

The age gap itself isn't necessarily the problem—it's the life-stage mismatch. If they're 23 and want to travel and explore, that's completely normal for someone that age. But if you're 35 and ready to settle down, you need to decide if you're willing to wait for them to catch up to where you are, or if you need someone who's already at that stage. Remember that your partner was 21 when you first started dating them. That's only barely old enough to drink. And it's only a few years past high school. When you reached drinking age, they were only 9 and in elementary school. By the time they catch up to where you are now, you might be in your early to mid-40s. And while I don't want to presume the gender of either of you, that's generally a late age to start having kids. 

So you need to ask yourself some hard questions. Then if you haven't already done so, have a frank and honest conversation with them. Open with something like: "I love you, and I want to make sure we're on the same page about where we're headed. I'm thinking about buying a house and potentially having kids in the next few years. Where are you with these things? What does your timeline look like?" Pay attention to their answers. Are they open to having those conversations? Do they seem to want similar things, just on a different timeline? Or are you fundamentally wanting different things? You need to be honest with yourself about what you want and whether this relationship can provide it. Don't stay in a relationship hoping someone will change or "catch up"—that's a recipe for resentment. Either you're both moving in the same direction, and at a speed that you feel works well for both of you, or you need to acknowledge that you might be on different paths.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for four years, and we're both in our early 30s. We've been talking about having kids, but we have very different ideas about parenting. I was raised with strict rules, clear consequences, and high expectations. My partner was raised in a much more permissive household where kids had a lot of freedom and choices. I think kids need structure and boundaries to thrive, while my partner thinks too many rules stifle creativity and independence. We've tried to discuss this, but we both get defensive because our approaches are tied to our own childhood experiences. How do we figure out a parenting style we can both agree on before we have kids?

ANSWER: This is exactly the kind of conversation you need to have before having children, so good on you for recognizing it. The key is to move away from "my way vs. your way" and toward "what works best for kids." Start by reading some evidence-based parenting books together—look for sources that cite research rather than just personal philosophy. Books like "The Whole-Brain Child" by Daniel Siegel or "How to Talk So Kids Will Listen" by Adele Faber can give you a shared foundation based on child development research rather than your individual upbringings.

Then, instead of debating strict vs. permissive, talk about specific scenarios: "How would we handle it if our 5-year-old refuses to go to bed?" or "What do we do if our teenager wants to go to a party we're not comfortable with?" Focus on the principles behind your approaches—you value structure and safety, your partner values autonomy and trust. Both are valid, and the best parenting often combines elements of both. You might find that you can agree on boundaries around safety and health (non-negotiable) while giving kids more freedom in areas like hobbies or clothing choices (negotiable). Consider taking a parenting class together or seeing a couples therapist who specializes in pre-parenting counseling. The goal isn't to convince each other that one approach is right, but to build a shared philosophy that incorporates both of your values.

QUESTION: My girlfriend and I have been together for two years, and we're both in our late 20s. She just got offered her dream job, but it's in a city about 500 miles away. She wants to take it, and she's asked me to move with her. I have a good job here that I enjoy, my family lives nearby, and I've built a life in this city. I love her and I want to support her career, but I'm not sure I'm ready to uproot my entire life. She's hurt that I'm hesitating and says it shows I'm not committed to our future. How do we figure this out?

ANSWER: This is a major life decision that requires honest conversation, not guilt or pressure. Her hurt is understandable—she's interpreting your hesitation as a lack of commitment—but moving far away for a partner is a huge ask that deserves careful consideration, not an immediate yes. You need to have a real conversation about what this move would mean for both of you: What would your job prospects look like in the new city? How would you maintain your relationships with family and friends? What's the long-term plan—is this permanent, or is there a timeline for potentially moving back? Are there compromises—could you try long-distance for a period while you both explore options?

The bigger question is whether you see a future together regardless of location. If you do, then this becomes a logistics problem you can solve together. If you don't, then the location question is really a proxy for a deeper incompatibility. Be honest with yourself and her about where you are. It's okay to say, "I need time to think about this because it's a major decision that affects my career, my relationships, and my life. Can we talk through the practicalities and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us?" If she can't give you that space and continues to frame it as a test of your commitment, that's a red flag. A healthy partnership allows both people to make major life decisions thoughtfully, not under pressure.

My partner is allergic to cats and doesn't really like them anyway. They've suggested I rehome my cats before we move in together, but I can't imagine giving them up. My partner says it's not fair to expect them to live with animals they're allergic to and don't want, but I feel like asking me to give up my pets is asking me to give up part of my family. How do we resolve this?

ANSWER: This is a fundamental incompatibility that needs to be addressed before you move in together. Your partner is right that it's not fair to expect them to live with animals they're allergic to, but you're also right that asking you to rehome pets you've had for years is a significant ask. (And in my view, a deal-breaker. But I'll get to that in a moment.) The question is whether there's a compromise that works for both of you, or whether this is a deal-breaker for one or both of you.

First, explore the allergy issue: has your partner tried allergy medication or immunotherapy? Some people can manage cat allergies with medication, though it's not a guarantee. If the allergy is severe and can't be managed, then you're looking at a choice: either you keep your cats and don't live together (at least not in the same space), or you rehome the cats. But before you make that decision, you need to be honest with yourself about what you can live with. If rehoming your cats would cause you lasting resentment, then that's not a viable solution—it will poison your relationship. And it will be traumatic for the cats. You and your partner might stay together or you might not, but for the cats, the trauma of permanent separation will last for the rest of their lives. 

You need to think hard about whether you're compatible for cohabitation right now. Some couples make it work by living separately, or by waiting until circumstances change (like the cats passing away naturally, though that's obviously not something to rush). The key is to have an honest conversation about what each of you can and can't accept, and to make a decision based on that, not on pressure or guilt.

Honestly, though, it seems to me that even if the allergy problem can be managed, this is a serious and probably insurmountable incompatibility problem. You love your cats and see them as family. And your partner “doesn't really like [cats] anyway.” So even if they grudgingly agree to cohabit with you with your cats around, and the allergy can be brought under control, it's unlikely to be a happy situation for either of you. They will resent you for being "forced" to live with animals they don't like, and you'll pick up on their resentment, even if  they don’t verbalize it, and you'll resent them in turn. (Of course, it's possible that the opposite can happen, and your partner could fall in love with the cats when they actually start living with them--provided, of course, that the allergy can be taken care of. But I have found that it's very risky to make big decisions like this based on wishful thinking.) This seems like one of those situations where the honest and respectful thing to do would be to break up and find someone more compatible.

QUESTION: I've been in a serious relationship for a few years now. Things have been going really well between us. I mean, we have our issues like every couple, but overall, things are great. I love him, he loves me, we both love each other's families. The problem is that he's expressed interest in opening up the relationship. I'm not enthused about the idea. Although I don't consider myself particularly religious or traditional, I do think that intimate relationships should be one-on-one. No judgment towards anybody else, but that's how I want my own life to be. He says that he wants to explore other people outside the relationship but remain committed to me. He cited several examples of our friends who have done it and he emphasizes that I would always remain his primary partner. He also said that I can meet any and all of his other partners and that he would be above board about everything. I have no reason to think he's seeing someone behind my back. He's always been honest. But I don't really feel comfortable with an open relationship. I've expressed this, but he keeps bringing it up. Is there hope for us?

ANSWER: Polyamorous relationships are increasingly common nowadays. I think you have the right approach by being non-judgmental, but also by knowing what you want personally. Since he has mentioned it multiple times even though you've expressed not wanting to pursue this, this seems like a fundamental incompatibility issue. How exactly does he respond when you tell him you're not interested? Is it dismissive, or does it seem sincere? Polyamory is something that both relationship partners have to sign off on. And in fact, not just sign off on, but be committed to. In spite of common misconceptions, polyamory takes just as much commitment as a traditional monogamous relationship, and in some ways even more, since it's incumbent upon each partner to inform their original partner of everyone else they're sleeping with, plus get STD tests and do other due diligence. And there are always concerns about developing an emotional connection with a secondary partner that outweighs that with a primary partner.

The fundamental question is whether you want a polyamorous relationship or keep your current partner. Apparently you can't have both. I would have one more conversation with him in which you are crystal clear that you love him and you want to stay with him, but polyamory just isn't for you. Tell him that if he truly wants a polyamorous relationship, that it won't work out between you two. Ask him point-blank if he wants to go ahead with polyamory or if he wants to remain with you. Emphasize that he can't have both--in a loving way, of course, not in a way that sounds like an ultimatum. I know that even broaching the subject of a breakup can be very painful in a relationship as committed as yours seems to be. But better to determine that now rather than later. Good luck.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for a year, and things are mostly good. But there's one issue: we have very different comfort levels with public displays of affection. I'm someone who likes to hold hands, give quick kisses, put my arm around my partner when we're out. He's much more reserved and says he's not comfortable with PDA—he'll hold my hand sometimes, but that's about it. When I try to be affectionate in public, he pulls away or seems embarrassed. I feel rejected, and he feels pressured. We've talked about it, but we can't seem to find a middle ground. How do we navigate this?

ANSWER: This is a common problem, and both comfort levels are valid. The key is finding a compromise that respects both of your boundaries rather than one person having to completely accommodate the other. Start by having a conversation about what specifically makes each of you uncomfortable: is it any physical contact in public, or are certain things okay (like holding hands) while others aren't (like kissing)? Understanding the specifics can help you find a middle ground.

Then, try to meet in the middle. Maybe you agree that holding hands and brief hugs are okay, but more intimate displays of affection are saved for private. Or maybe you have certain contexts where PDA is more acceptable (like at a party with friends) versus others where it's not (like in a professional setting or around family). The goal is to find a level of affection that you're both comfortable with, not to convince him to be more affectionate or you to be less affectionate.

It's also worth considering whether this is a symptom of a larger issue: does he show affection in private? Does he make you feel loved and valued in other ways? If the only issue is public affection and you're both happy with your private relationship, then this might just be a difference in comfort levels that you can work around. But if he's also reserved in private or if you're feeling generally unloved or rejected, then this might be a sign of a deeper incompatibility that needs to be addressed.

QUESTION: My younger sister has taken up this strange new habit of commenting on my appearance every time we see each other. It’s always framed as concern about my health or “just trying to be honest,” but the comments land hard and linger with me for days. I’ve already tried gently telling her that these remarks don’t feel supportive, yet she insists she’s doing it out of love and that I’m being overly sensitive. I’m starting to dread family gatherings because I never know what she’ll say next. She isn’t trying to be cruel, but the pattern is wearing me down. How do I set a boundary she will actually respect?

ANSWER: First, let me ask: what's changed recently that might explain this behavior on her part? You frame her actions as a "strange new habit." This suggests that it hasn't been going on very long. You might want to start by asking her if there's anything in her life that's changed that's led her to start asking these questions of you. This might not solve the problem on its own, but it could be a step in the right direction. Or she might not feel comfortable discussing this with you, but it's worth a shot.

Regardless, you will need to set better boundaries with her. Since the softer approach didn’t shift her behavior, you need to set a boundary that is both clear and firm. The key is to remove the debate entirely. Instead of explaining why her comments hurt or asking her to see them differently, state the limit as a simple fact: “I’m not discussing my body or my weight with you. If you bring it up again, I will end the conversation and step away.”

Deliver it calmly and without extra justification. You’re not asking for her approval. You’re naming your boundary.

Then, and this is the difficult part, you must follow through. The moment she crosses the line, end the interaction immediately. No flustered explanations, no arguing, no trying to convince her that you’re reasonable. Just a short “I’m going to step away now,” and do it.

This isn’t about punishing her. It’s about teaching her, through consistent action, that certain topics are not up for discussion. Some people only take boundaries seriously when there is a predictable consequence. Holding that line may feel uncomfortable at first, but it is often the only way to truly change behavior. You’re allowed to protect your well-being.

QUESTION: My fiancé has a lifelong best friend who has always been part of our social circle, but lately I leave gatherings feeling deflated. His friend has a habit of making jokes at my expense. None of them are hateful or crude, but they’re pointed enough that I feel more scrutinized than included. When I mentioned this to my fiancé, he brushed it off as “just his sense of humor” and said not to take it personally. The problem is that I do take it personally, because I’m the one absorbing it. I don’t want to ask him to choose sides, but I also don’t want to spend the rest of my life avoiding someone who matters to him. How can I bring this up in a way that makes him understand the emotional reality without making it a fight?

ANSWER: Focus on describing the impact rather than diagnosing the friend’s behavior. Instead of saying “he’s rude” or “he targets me,” try something like: “I know he’s important to you. I just leave these hangouts feeling drained and a bit singled out, and I want to talk about how we can make those situations feel less lopsided.”

This invites your fiancé into the problem with you rather than casting him as the gatekeeper for his friend. After that, shift toward what support would look like. Maybe you’d feel more comfortable if your fiancé stepped in when the friend’s jokes start piling up, or if he changed the subject instead of letting the moment linger. You’re not asking him to confront his friend dramatically. You’re asking him to help shape the tone of group interactions so you feel more grounded and respected. Standing up for you doesn't have to be hostile unless the friend really pushes the matter. It can just look like your fiance changing the subject or saying something like, "Hey, you know, she doesn't like these jokes very much. Let's stick to a topic that we can all enjoy."

If he struggles to respond, explore what’s underneath that. Sometimes partners minimize these things because they feel caught between loyalty and discomfort. Naming that tension gently can help him see that you’re not attacking the friendship, but trying to create a dynamic where you don’t bear the brunt of someone else’s humor.

Bottom line, you don't have to live your life in fear of the next harsh joke. If your fiancé can't or won't stand up to his friend, that's an early indicator that he may not stand up for you in difficult situations in the future. Because what happens, say, five years down the road, when his new friend from work starts commenting on your body or on some idiosyncrasy that you have? Is the fiancé (who would then be your husband presumably) going to be a puddle of goo then, or is he going to stand up for you? If he's not standing up for you now, then he's not likely to do so down the road, unless you two have a discussion where you make clear that he needs to step up more for you when his friend makes these jokes, and then he actually follows through and does it.

This can be solvable if both of you stay oriented toward the shared goal: making social time feel welcoming for everyone involved. If your fiancé can't or won't do this, it's time to question whether he's the best match for the rest of your life.

QUESTION: One of my coworkers is very friendly and has made a point of inviting me to various after-work activities. I’ve turned down the invitations every time, partly because I’m introverted and partly because I like keeping a clear line between my work life and my personal time. He never gets pushy or inappropriate, but he is persistent. Even after several polite nos, he keeps asking as though I might suddenly change my mind. I don’t want to embarrass him or make things awkward at work, but I also don’t want to spend the rest of the year repeating myself. How can I shut this down kindly but firmly?

ANSWER: When polite refusals don’t work, it usually means the other person is interpreting them as circumstantial rather than categorical. Or he's just quite socially inept. Regardless of why he's doing this, though, you need to give him a clear and unambiguous statement that leaves no room for hope. Something like: “I appreciate the invitation, but I don’t do social events outside of work. That’s a personal boundary for me, and it’s not going to change. I just want to be upfront so you don’t feel like you need to keep asking.”

This removes the ambiguity and gives him a way to save face. He didn’t misread your signals. He simply did not have full information.

If he slips and invites you again, keep your response short and steady: “As I mentioned before, I don’t do after-work hangouts.” No apologies, no elaboration. Reducing the emotional padding in these moments actually makes it easier for him to adjust because the message is consistent. The last resort would be after several more times when he doesn't get the message, go to HR about this. But, of course, there could be professional and personal costs to this, hence why it should only be a last resort.

Handled this way, the work relationship doesn’t need to suffer. Most people appreciate clarity once they have it, even if it wasn’t the answer they hoped for.

QUESTION: My teenage son has been irritable and withdrawn for weeks. He comes home from school, goes straight to his room, and barely speaks to anyone. His grades have slipped, and when I try to check in he insists he’s fine and just wants to be left alone. Part of me wants to push harder because I’m worried something serious is going on. Another part of me remembers what it felt like to be a teenager and how suffocating it was when adults demanded explanations I wasn’t ready to give. I feel stuck between wanting to respect his space and wanting to make sure he’s not silently drowning. How do I show up for him in a way that actually helps?

ANSWER: The key is to create multiple low-pressure avenues for connection. Teenagers often shut down when conversations feel like interrogations, but they will open up in small, sideways ways when the setting feels safe. Try brief check-ins during shared activities: a car ride, cooking dinner, folding laundry. Keep the tone light. Something like, “You seem stressed lately. I’m around if you ever want to talk,” is often more effective than “Tell me what’s going on.”

At the same time, gently monitor the basics: sleep, appetite, school workload, changes in friend groups. Reach out to teachers or counselors if you’re seeing consistent decline. You’re not tattling. You’re gathering context.

If he continues to withdraw or shows signs of depression, bring in a mental health professional. Many teenagers open up more easily to someone who isn’t a parent, and having a neutral adult in the picture can relieve both of you. You’re not abandoning your role by asking for help. You’re broadening the support system so he doesn’t have to navigate a tough period alone.

The balance you’re trying to strike is real, and it’s delicate. But showing steady, non-intrusive care is often exactly what a struggling teenager needs.

QUESTION: I've been married for a few years. My wife and I are mostly open with each other about things. But I have one thing that I haven't told her about. I watch porn. It's always from mainstream sites. Never underage porn. And I never interact with any of the performers directly, a la OnlyFans. I usually do it when I'm sleeping in the other room for various reasons, or sometimes when she goes out for a while. I feel guilty about this, but at the same time, I also feel like it's important to me since our libidos are mismatched. My libido is significantly higher than hers.

I feel that this is a better solution to the libido problem than actually going out and having an affair, but part of me feels this is still cheating because after all, I am deliberately getting sexually stimulated by other women's bodies. Is this cheating? What's your verdict on this?

ANSWER: The use of sensual materials, when all common sense and ethical guidelines are met, is a question that good people can disagree upon. Some marriages can still do well when one or both partners use porn, whereas it kills other marriages. I'd start by asking yourself a few questions. First, why haven't you told your wife about this porn use? Is it that you're worried about her reaction? Do you feel ashamed? You did mention that you feel that it feels like a "betrayal." But engage in a thought exercise for a moment: how would you compare the following situations when it comes to whether it's a betrayal of your spouse: Watching porn; reading an erotic novel; masturbating through pure fantasy?

Almost all married people masturbate at least sometimes in their marriage. So that fact itself isn't a reason to feel bad or like you're betraying your spouse. And I gave you the above list to get you thinking about what really separates porn from these other activities. Not to justify porn but to simply try to isolate your thinking as far as what its role is or should be in your life. I think the biggest issue here though is the secretiveness. You should have a frank conversation with your spouse about this. Mention using these materials and mention your concern about them. Even if they disagree with your use of them, hopefully they will react in a compassionate and loving way. And also look at Bernie Zilbergeld's book, "The New Male Sexuality." He offers a lot of common sense advice on such topics.

QUESTION: My husband and I usually communicate well, but lately we’ve been getting stuck in the same argument about how we spend our free time. I’m someone who likes to plan outings or small activities on the weekends. He prefers to decompress at home and gets overwhelmed when he feels like the weekend is scheduled. When I bring up wanting to do more together, he hears it as criticism. When he asks for quieter weekends, I hear it as disinterest. We’re not fighting constantly, but we keep circling this mismatch and neither of us feels fully understood. How do we bridge this without either of us feeling steamrolled?

ANSWER: Start by shifting the frame from “How do we solve this?” to “How do we understand each other better?” Because underneath the scheduling conflict is a clash of needs: your desire for shared experiences and his desire for rest. Try approaching the conversation with that lens. For example: “I’m not trying to take away your downtime. I just feel more connected when we have a few planned moments together. Can we talk about how to make space for both?”

Once you’ve established that you’re both trying to meet real needs rather than win an argument, experiment with structure. Maybe you designate one weekend day as low-key and keep one small planned outing on the other. Or you agree on two or three “anchor points” each month so he can anticipate the energy required. You’re not erasing his need for rest or your desire for activity. You’re creating a rhythm you both can breathe in.

Finally, check in periodically about how it’s going. These patterns evolve as stress levels and life demands shift. The goal isn’t perfect balance every week. It’s a sense that both of you matter in the equation.

QUESTION: My older brother has always had a forceful personality, but lately he has started giving me unsolicited advice about every aspect of my life. My job, my finances, my relationship, even how I organize my house. He means well, but the constant commentary makes me feel like I’m being managed rather than supported. If I push back, he gets offended and says he’s only trying to help. I don’t want to damage the relationship, but I can’t keep absorbing this. How do I set a boundary with someone who thinks boundaries are personal attacks?

ANSWER: People who overreach often believe their intentions should override your experience, so start by separating the two. You might say: “I know you want the best for me, but the unsolicited advice is overwhelming and unwelcome. I need to come to you when I want input, not feel like I’m being evaluated all the time.” This honors his intention while making your limit unmistakable.

Then be explicit about what you want going forward. Something like: “Unless I ask for advice, I need you to just listen.” No apologies, no over-explanation. Just clarity.

If he reacts defensively, keep your tone warm but firm: “I’m not questioning your desire to help. I’m asking for space to handle things my own way.” His discomfort does not mean the boundary is wrong. It just means it’s new.

You also say that “lately” he has “started” giving you unwanted advice. This implies it's a relatively new development, at least in its frequency. Do you have a new relationship, a new job, or some other recent event that has triggered this? I ask this not to justify his behavior, but to try to understand it a bit better. It's possible that his overbearing actions are hiding a deeper fear or insecurity. Just to give a hypothetical example, someone whose sibling just started a new relationship might worry about how their sibling’s new partner will treat them; being overbearing might be their way of coping. Not saying this is what's happening with you, but just suggesting that there might be multiple things going on here aside from just his “forceful personality.”

Regardless, consistency is the lever here. The first few times he lapses, redirect calmly: “I’m not looking for advice right now.” Over time, even the most well-meaning micromanagers learn that your autonomy is not up for negotiation.

QUESTION: My college-age daughter comes home on breaks and immediately reverts to treating me like a full-time provider. She expects meals, laundry help, rides, and emotional labor on demand. I love her and I’m glad she feels at home here, but I’m exhausted by how quickly my boundaries get erased the moment she walks through the door. When I try to bring it up, she gets defensive and says she’s only home for a short time, so why can’t things just be easy? How do I reset expectations without turning every visit into a standoff?

ANSWER: Start by acknowledging the transition she’s navigating. Coming home often triggers old roles for both parents and young adults. But then name your reality: “I love having you here, and I want this to be a place you can relax. At the same time, I can’t take on every responsibility the way I did when you were younger.”

Be specific about what needs to change. Instead of “I need more help,” try: “If you want laundry done, it needs to be your responsibility,” or “I’m happy to cook some meals, but not every meal.” Concrete expectations reduce the emotional charge.

If she protests, stay calm: “I’m not trying to make your time here stressful. I’m trying to make sure it’s sustainable for both of us.” Give her a little space to adjust; role shifts rarely happen overnight.

Over time, the goal is to build a new adult-to-adult rhythm rather than sliding automatically into parent-child mode. You’re not being harsh. You’re updating the household contract so it respects both of you.

QUESTION: I’m in a close friend group where everyone usually gets along, but two people had a falling-out months ago and the tension is still affecting the whole dynamic. They avoid each other, make pointed remarks, and sometimes try to recruit the rest of us to “their side.” I’m tired of feeling like I’m walking through interpersonal landmines every time we all hang out. I care about both, but I don’t want to be a mediator or referee anymore. How can I protect my own peace without alienating either friend?

ANSWER: You don’t need to fix their conflict, but you do need to define your role in it. Start by telling each of them privately, and gently, that you’re stepping out of the middle. Something like: “I care about you, but I can’t be part of conversations that pull me into conflict with the other person. I want to stay neutral and keep our friendship separate from whatever the two of you are working through.”

The “interpersonal landmines” dynamic poisons group hangouts. You all have a right to be able to spend time together without constantly feeling like you're walking on eggshells. Have you spoken privately with some other group members about this? Not to gossip, but to try to get on the same page about how to handle it. It's likely that others feel the same as you do about the situation. 

This additional support might help you to set a consistent boundary in group settings. If the tension surfaces, redirect or disengage. “Let’s not go there” or “I’m not getting into that” is enough. You’re not scolding the two who are fighting. You’re declining the invitation to be collateral. Repeat as necessary. 

If group hangouts continue to feel strained, consider hosting smaller gatherings with different configurations so you’re not constantly managing the fallout. You’re allowed to curate your social life. Caring about people doesn’t require absorbing their unresolved conflicts.

You’re choosing self-preservation, not sides.

QUESTION: My partner and I recently merged our finances, and we’re discovering that we have very different spending habits. I’m frugal and tend to think months ahead. He’s more spontaneous and comfortable with impulse purchases. Neither of us is reckless, but the mismatch has caused a few tense conversations about what counts as “necessary,” and I can feel resentment creeping in. How do we navigate this without turning every purchase into a referendum on our values?

ANSWER: Start by separating the emotional layer from the logistical one. Spending habits often reflect deeper stories—security, identity, pleasure, scarcity. You might say: “I think our reactions to money come from different places. I’d like to understand yours better, and I want to explain mine so we’re not guessing at each other’s motives.”

Then build a system that contains the differences rather than erases them. That might mean setting a monthly discretionary allowance for each of you—money you can spend without explanation. Or creating a threshold above which you both discuss a purchase beforehand. Clear rules remove the ambiguity that fuels resentment.

You might even take the monthly discretionary allowance idea one step further and decouple your finances a bit. Still maintain a joint account, but also maintain separate bank accounts. This isn’t for everyone but it works for a lot of couples as it strikes a balance between having shared finances and having funds for each partner to spend how they wish. Your partner will likely offer resistance when you bring up the idea of partially re-separating your finances. You can explain that it's a practical step that has nothing to do with how you feel about them or whether you trust them. It's a way for the two of you to respect each other's differences and to reduce conflict over spending. 

Finally, check in regularly. Not about individual purchases, but how the system feels. You’re not trying to force each other into identical spending styles. You’re trying to build a shared financial culture that gives both of you room to breathe. When you treat it as something you’re designing together, the conversations get easier and the stakes feel lower.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over two years, and we generally communicate well, but there’s one recurring issue I can’t seem to crack. When he gets stressed about work, he completely shuts down emotionally. He doesn’t get angry or lash out. He just becomes quiet, withdrawn, and unreachable. I’ve tried giving him space, and I’ve tried gently checking in, but both approaches leave me feeling shut out. I don’t need him to be cheerful all the time, but I do need some sense of connection during hard weeks. I’m worried that if we don’t figure this out, we’ll drift into a pattern where stress equals distance. How can I help him open up without adding more pressure?

ANSWER: Start by naming the pattern without judgment. Something like: “I’ve noticed that when work gets overwhelming, you tend to pull inward. I want to support you, but I also want us to stay connected during those times. Can we talk about what kind of support actually feels helpful to you?”

This shifts the conversation from “Why are you shutting me out?” to “How do we navigate stress as a team?” Then explore concrete possibilities. Maybe he needs a predictable check-in each evening, or maybe what helps is physical closeness rather than conversation. Sometimes people withdraw not because they don’t trust their partner, but because they never learned what healthy support looks like.

From there, agree on a small shared practice. For example, even if he isn’t ready to talk, he might say, “It’s a hard day, but I love you. I’m just needing quiet.” That one sentence preserves the connection and reassures you that his silence isn’t a rejection.

You’re not trying to change his coping style completely. You’re trying to weave the relationship into it so neither of you feels alone in the process. With patience and clarity, this can become one of the strengths of your partnership rather than a fracture line.

QUESTION: I feel that I'm a walking, breathing cliche. I'm a 54-year-old woman whose similarly-aged husband cheated on me with his 24-year-old secretary. It's really the oldest story on God's green earth. I naively took him at his word when he told me that he was working late on Monday and Wednesday evenings. He told me that he had a big project to finish up, and his boss had laid off his assistant, so he was forced to do two people's jobs. Thus, he had to spend many hours at work outside of the workday to get it all done. 

Imagine my surprise when my best friend told me that she had seen my husband and a much younger woman out at a nice restaurant after working hours while my friend was on a date there! I confronted him, and after initial predictable denials, he confessed. He told me she made him feel young and wanted. Again, you can find countless examples of this story down to the small details. But now that I'm reeling from this betrayal, I'm wondering whether to stay or to leave him. He has always been a good husband and provider, and I believe him when he told me that he hasn't slept with anybody outside of the marriage except for the secretary. He swore to me he would change. However, a couple of weeks ago, after we tried to reconcile, my friend once again saw him out with his girlfriend at the same restaurant. (He could have at least been smart about it and gone to a different restaurant with her.) Clearly he hasn't ended things with her. He has many good qualities, but I don't know if I can forgive him for this. Should I stay or should I go?

ANSWER: I am sorry you are in this situation. Nobody deserves to be cheated on. Whether to stay or go in the event of an extramarital affair is one of those questions where good, reasonable people can disagree. Some are of the opinion that even one incident of cheating is too much, and that the trust can never be restored. On the other hand, others subscribe to the school of thought of allowing their partners a second or even third chance. Clearly you're at least open to the possibility of taking him back, but given that this betrayal has happened multiple times and that the deceit is continuing after his assurances that it wouldn't, I would be hesitant about taking him back.

If you haven't already, find a good therapist to discuss this issue with. Try to look for larger patterns. For instance, have you been cheated on before and then taken a partner back? What happened then? Your husband told you that he hasn't cheated on you with anyone except for the secretary, but has he engaged in any other dishonest behavior, such as using family money for questionable purposes? Usually when somebody is deceitful or dishonest in one area, they act similarly in other areas. Ultimately, the decision on whether to stay or go is yours, but I would exercise caution regarding his ability to change given what you've experienced thus far. If there were a graveyard for all failed relationships and marriages, probably about half of the headstones would read: "I tried to change them."

QUESTION: My close friend recently started dating someone new, and while I want to be supportive, every interaction I’ve had with his partner has left me uneasy. They dominate conversations, interrupt constantly, and seem dismissive of my friend’s opinions in subtle but persistent ways. My friend seems smitten and hasn’t noticed any of this. I don’t want to rain on his happiness, but I’m worried about the dynamic I’m observing. How do I express concern without sounding judgmental or territorial?

ANSWER: Start with curiosity rather than conclusions. You might say: “I’m glad you’re happy. I’ve noticed a few moments where it seemed like your partner talked over you or dismissed your ideas. I’m not sure if that’s just their style, but I wanted to check in about how you’re feeling in the relationship.”

This approach centers his experience rather than your interpretation. You’re not telling him what to think. You’re inviting him to reflect. As you've alluded to, new relationships involve constant conscious and unconscious filtering. We downplay or ignore the negative things we see from our new love interest while amplifying the positives. So it's natural that he has the rosy-eyed glasses on. But gently pointing out these concerns could send a signal that could become useful once the rosy-eyed glasses come off. You're not only pointing out red flags to him; you're also setting yourself up to be a source of support and a landing spot if or when all this goes south.

If he brushes it off, don’t push. Instead, keep the door open: “If anything ever feels off, I’m here.” That reassures him and subtly conveys your concern without coming off as overbearing.

If the relationship is healthy, your concern won’t harm it. If it isn’t, your comment might be the seed that helps him notice patterns later. Either way, you’ve spoken with care rather than judgment.

QUESTION: I’ve become close friends with someone at work, and the friendship has been great, but lately he’s been leaning on me in ways that feel more intimate than a typical workplace bond. Long messages late at night, venting about loneliness, asking for emotional reassurance. He has a partner, and so do I, and nothing explicitly romantic has happened, but the line feels blurry. I don’t want to lose the friendship, but I also don’t want to compromise boundaries I care about. How can I reset things without making it awkward at work?

ANSWER: Start by reestablishing the frame of the relationship. Try something like: “I value our friendship, but some of our recent conversations have gotten a bit more personal than I’m comfortable with. I want to make sure we keep good boundaries, especially since we both have partners.”

Lonely people often are keen to reach out to others, and at times, this drive can override the usual social boundaries. Emotional affairs usually begin as friendships of the type that you describe. I take you at your word that nothing romantic has happened, but as you also alluded to, it can be a slippery slope. It's best for everyone concerned to put a kibosh on this possibility now, rather than later.

That's why it's so important to set a clear limit about timing and topics. For example: “I’m going to stop responding to late-night messages. I'm also not comfortable discussing sensitive or intimate emotional topics. Let’s keep our conversations to work hours and to lighter topics.” You’re not rejecting him. You’re defining the shape of the connection.

If he reacts with embarrassment or over-apologizes, keep your tone steady: “There’s nothing wrong. I just want our friendship to stay in a place that feels good for both of us.” But if he does the opposite and reacts defensively or angrily, then that shows you something important as well. Regardless, connecting with a valued friend doesn't justify crossing lines that you don't want to cross.

Friendships at work can be meaningful, but they also benefit from guardrails. You’re creating these guardrails early enough that the relationship can adjust instead of rupture.

QUESTION: I've become very attracted to someone at my school. I'm in my mid-30s, and I am in an intensive vocational school that's co-educational. My cohort ranges in age from early 20s to 50s, although most of us are in the late 20s/early 30s range. I am a guy, and there's a girl in our cohort who is a few years younger than me. She and I are both introverts, and we bonded over this. She has also said that she sees me as handsome, though I need to remind myself that this doesn't necessarily indicate romantic interest. But I feel that our connection is becoming stronger with each conversation. We don't spend a lot of one-on-one time, but we always seem to end up talking to each other in group settings.

Unfortunately, she's engaged. I really want to be respectful of her relationship and not be a homewrecker, but at the same time I feel what I feel. Is there a way forward for us? Should I venture to satisfy my curiosity regarding whether she shares my feelings, or should I keep quiet about this?

ANSWER: While acknowledging the emotional complexities of the situation, I think you've answered your own questions. You want to respect her relationship, you don't want to be a homewrecker, and she's engaged. So that means that no, there's not a way forward for you two romantically, unless she breaks up with her fiancé. And needless to say, if this happens, it can't be because you contributed to it.

People have unrequited romantic feelings all the time, and also requited ones that can't be acted upon in situations such as yours. It's possible she shares your feelings, but it's equally possible she doesn't. And the larger point is that this is a question that needs to remain unanswered. Because, let's say she does share the feelings. Well, then what? There's no way for you two to act on them without breaking ethical rules that we can all agree on. So knowing that she shares these feelings, if she indeed does, would cause you even more torment. 

Continue to engage her as a friend within appropriate boundaries. Approach her with the mentality that romance is off the table and always will be. Some hard questions must remain unanswered.

QUESTION: My partner and I have different approaches to socializing. I enjoy hosting people and creating opportunities to bring our circles together. He prefers one-on-one interactions and finds group gatherings draining. I’ve tried balancing both, but lately I feel like I’m shrinking my social world to fit his preferences. When I bring it up, he says he doesn’t want to hold me back, but he still rarely participates. I don’t want to pressure him, yet I want a life that feels full. How do we navigate this mismatch?

ANSWER: Start by identifying what you actually need. Is it his active participation? Or is it his support for you to host and socialize freely? Once you know that, express it clearly: “I don’t need you at every gathering, but I do need to feel like I’m not choosing between my social life and our relationship.”

From there, propose a shared compromise. Perhaps he joins a few events each month, and the rest you host or attend without him. You’re creating a rhythm that preserves both his energy and your desire for community. This is one of those problems where there's ample compromise, even though it may not feel like it. 

In addition, is there a way for him to feel more comfortable at the larger social gatherings? I'm more on the introverted side, too, as your husband appears to be. I find that in large group settings, breaking out into smaller conversations is often much more comfortable for me than the intimidating setting of a large group. Something like this is probably already happening to some extent, but you can look for ways to make it a bit more structured. For example, is he a fan of games? Games can be a way to bring people together and can reduce the psychological barriers for more introverted people because there's a clear structure to it and more specific rules for interaction. And games are often turn-based, unlike conversational free-for-alls, which can make games much less intimidating to introverts than a large group conversation. I'm not saying to turn all of your social evenings into game nights. But for us introverts, we appreciate a bit of structure and more often than not respond well to it. 

Reassure him that opting out isn’t a failure. Many introverts feel guilty for not matching their partner’s social stamina. When you frame it as balance rather than pressure, he may feel freer to participate in ways that genuinely work for him. And over time, hopefully he will get to know the people at the gatherings who aren’t part of his circle better and find at least one or two people who he's comfortable enough with to talk to on a regular basis. This can also help a lot and make the atmosphere feel less daunting.

You’re not trying to merge personalities. You’re trying to build a life where both styles can breathe.

QUESTION: I work from home, as do many people. As many people have experienced in the work-from-home era, this can be at once liberating and lonely. None of my coworkers are even located in the city where I live, so I can't even meet up with them occasionally for coffee. But I have found a warm and inviting professional group in my area. These folks are passionate about the same things that I am, and I've been frequenting the group's meet-ups. I now even pay for a co-working space so that I can spend time with some of the same people during the workday. The culture and the vibe are great, and have been a huge morale boost in my work life.

The problem is that recently a new person has started to come to these meetups. He's kind on the surface, but after a while, he starts making nasty racist jokes and often speaks in a crude manner. He's borderline misogynist and seems to be a political reactionary. When he comes to the meetups, I try to relocate to another table. I haven't confronted him about the jokes because I don't want to rock the boat and cause an unpleasant situation with this group that I care so much about. But if he keeps coming, I don't know if I can keep coming. It would be heartbreaking to let him ruin my experience, however. How can I preserve my experience while also making it clear that his jokes are not okay?

ANSWER: Unfortunately, as you've discovered, a single person can ruin a dynamic. But by the same token, you have agency too. You said that you don't want to cause an unpleasant situation, but from my reading, you're already in such a situation. And I doubt you're the only one to experience discomfort over this. What I would do is: the next time he comes to your table, don't change tables, at least not before confronting him, if needed, in a polite but firm manner. If he makes one of the racist jokes, you can say something like, "Hey, I think that members of X group would find this offensive." Or, "How would you feel if you were in their shoes?" 

This person or others might very well respond by claiming that they're just joking and that you're being too sensitive. But if this happens, then you can say things like, "I know that different people have different brands of humor, but these jokes are dehumanizing, and I don't find them funny." Or, "These jokes cross a line for me, and I'm not comfortable with that. I want this space to remain a place where everyone feels included and can have a good time. Can you please refrain from making these jokes while I'm around?"

A lot will depend not only on how this person responds but also on how others in the group respond, particularly the leadership. If, after taking your concerns to the person in question, the situation still isn't improving, then you might want to take your concerns to the leadership. But if the leadership brushes it off or justifies the jokes in some way, even by just saying, "Oh, they're just joking around, they're not being serious," then I would reconsider what kind of culture these leaders are creating. I know this group is important to you, but I would wager that your integrity is as well. Life sometimes forces us to make hard choices between our integrity and other things that matter to us. I hope this isn't the case, but unfortunately, this might be one of those situations.

QUESTION: My younger cousin frequently asks me for career advice, which I’m happy to give, but the pattern is becoming draining. He’ll ask for guidance, I’ll spend time talking him through options, and then he’ll do the exact opposite or drop the conversation entirely until the next crisis. I’m starting to feel like a sounding board rather than a mentor. I want him to succeed, but I can’t keep investing energy into conversations he doesn’t act on. How do I help him without becoming a revolving door of advice?

ANSWER: Shift from providing solutions to setting expectations. Try: “I’m happy to be someone you can talk to, but I’ve noticed that we go over the same topics and nothing really changes. I want to make sure my support is actually useful.”

Then ask him what he hopes to gain from these conversations. Many people seek reassurance, not guidance, and naming that can reset the dynamic. You might also introduce some structure: “Before we talk, think about one or two options you’re genuinely considering.” This puts responsibility back on him.

Careers can be stressful and intimidating, especially if you're at the beginning stages of one. So, it's possible that your cousin is just stressed or overwhelmed. But you're not wrong to expect follow-through. His future bosses certainly will, and you nudging him in the right direction might be a good lesson for his future career. After all, ignoring your advice now is far lower stakes than ignoring what a boss asks him to do for a project due next week. So let this be a lesson in accountability.

If he continues the same pattern, step back gently: “I care about you, but I can’t keep revisiting these decisions when there’s no follow-through. Let me know when you’re ready to take concrete steps, and I’ll be here.” You’re not withdrawing love. You’re withdrawing from a cycle that isn’t serving either of you.

QUESTION: My boss is kind and supportive, but she relies on me emotionally in a way that feels inappropriate for a workplace. She vents about her stress, asks for reassurance, and sometimes uses phrases like “I don’t know what I’d do without you.” I like her and want to maintain a good relationship, but I don’t want to become her emotional anchor. How do I create distance without damaging my standing at work?

ANSWER: Keep the tone warm and professional. You might say: “I appreciate that you trust me, and I want to support the team. At the same time, I need to keep some boundaries so I can focus on my role.”

Then gently redirect the emotional conversations toward appropriate channels. If she begins unloading personal stress, respond with something like: “That sounds overwhelming. Have you talked to HR or someone on the leadership team about getting more support?” This signals care without absorbing responsibility. It's tricky because you don't want to sound like you're usurping her boss role by telling her what to do. It's a fine line. But framing your suggestions as just that, suggestions, might help reduce this potential problem. Something like: “This is just a suggestion, but last week, you talked to me about how stressful our relationship with Client X is. Do you think that you could assign some of Client X's lower-stakes work to our new intern, Jean? This could help reduce your load.”

If she uses emotionally loaded language—“I don’t know what I’d do without you”—you can deflect with professionalism: “I’m glad I can help, and I’m committed to the work we’re doing.” No deeper reassurance. Or you could say something like, "Thanks for your confidence in me. I'm focused on making sure that Client Y is pleased with our work this quarter."

You’re not rejecting her. You’re anchoring the relationship back in its intended structure. Work boundaries protect both career growth and mental health.

QUESTION: My younger sister and I used to be close, but ever since she joined a very tight-knit religious community, our relationship has grown strained. She’s kind and still reaches out, but conversations feel scripted, and she gently critiques my choices in ways she never used to. She keeps inviting me to events that feel more like recruitment than connection. I miss who we were to each other, but I also want to respect her path. How do I keep the relationship alive without feeling pressured to participate in a belief system that isn’t mine?

ANSWER: Start by affirming the bond you want to preserve. Something like: “I love you, and I want us to stay close. But I need to be honest: I feel pressured when our conversations center on your community or when invitations sound like recruitment.”

Proselytizing, by its nature, can feel dismissive of personal choice and often carries an assumption that the devotee's beliefs are superior to the other person's. While most people who proselytize are acting out of good intentions, the approach frequently comes across as forceful and unwelcome, and ultimately often only succeeds in imposing distance. I'm sure your sister means well, but the pressure on you to participate is clearly taking a toll on your relationship.

That's why boundaries are especially essential in these types of situations. And this starts by clarifying what type of relationship you want to have with your sister moving forward. “I’m happy to hear about your life, but I’m not comfortable attending events tied to your group. I want to connect as siblings, not as someone evaluating a belief system.” If she persists (which she likely will), you could also say, "I respect the path that you've chosen, but it isn't my path and never will be. I want to pursue my own path, on my own terms. My beliefs are just as valid as yours, and I want us to engage with each other as equals, rather than as one person trying to convert the other."

Expect her to feel awkward at first. When someone’s identity changes, they often don’t realize how much their communication changes. Be consistent. Redirect gently when conversations slip into persuasion: “I appreciate you sharing, but let’s talk about us.” 

In my experience, proselytizing needs to be met by respectful but clear, consistent, and firm boundaries. As with many other types of boundaries, the boundaries that you set here need to be clear and unambiguous. Because even the smallest hesitation or ambiguity can give her an opening that she'd gladly take. And repetition is key here. Expect resistance and some "backsliding" on her part (sorry). But if you continue to convey your own needs and wishes in a kind, loving manner, that will increase the chance that she will come around to halting the recruitment pitches and engaging with you as a sibling again.

You’re not rejecting her faith. You’re shaping a version of the relationship that both of you can inhabit with honesty. The connection can evolve, but only if it’s grounded in mutual respect rather than quiet discomfort.

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have very different levels of political engagement. I attend rallies, donate, and stay active in local organizing. He supports my involvement but has little interest in participating himself, saying he prefers to “keep politics out of daily life.” Lately I’m feeling a sense of mismatch, like our values align in theory but not in practice. I’m worried that this will become a deeper divide over time. How do I talk about this without sounding self-righteous?

ANSWER: Short answer: you probably can’t. Asking him something like how he lives his values (which is really what you want to know, right?) will inevitably invite comparison to you and to your heavy activism, regardless of your intention in asking the question. This is partly because of how emotionally loaded political activism is, closely tied as it is to virtue signaling. But it's still worth discussing, since it's obviously very important to you. 

You can start with something like: “I know we agree on many issues, but civic engagement is a big part of how I live my values. I want to understand how you think about expressing yours.” Frame this as curiosity rather than judgment. He needs to feel that you want to be able to understand him better, rather than goading him into becoming more politically active. Because if he starts to sense the latter, he'll probably shut down.

Along these same lines, avoid framing involvement as a moral hierarchy. Instead, describe the emotional impact: “When I’m deeply engaged in something meaningful and you’re neutral, I sometimes feel alone. I want to understand where you’re coming from, not judge it.” And then give him space to explain his own perspective. 

From there, look for overlapping ground rather than identical action. Maybe he won’t march in the streets, but he might support you in smaller ways—researching issues, helping with logistics, or simply being a sounding board. Meaningful alignment doesn’t require carbon-copy activism or the loud forms of engagement that are often held up as superior to quieter forms. I have known of cases where introverts have stepped down from leadership posts in their political parties because the work just didn't match their personality. But they still contributed in other ways. Maybe your boyfriend is more of a “behind-the-scenes” type of guy. So I would urge you to see that as equally valid with other forms of activism. Recalibrating your own stance on activism could be an important step in helping you understand where he's coming from.

The goal isn’t to convert him. It’s to build a shared understanding so your engagement feels like part of the relationship rather than something you do in a separate emotional world.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for a few years, and we’ve always talked about wanting kids “someday.” Recently, I’ve felt that desire growing stronger, but when I brought it up more concretely, he hesitated. Not a firm no, but a real uncertainty. He says he needs more time to think about what he wants his life to look like. I don’t want to pressure him into parenthood, but I also don’t want to put my own timeline on hold indefinitely. How do we talk about something this big without turning it into an ultimatum?

ANSWER: This is a common but challenging situation. When partners differ on the all-important issue of whether or not to have kids, there are only a few outcomes that are possible. Either one of the partners genuinely changes their mind, in which case the pair either become parents (fertility or adoption processes allowing) or they don’t, with each partner fully on board. Or one of the two partners gives in without truly changing their mind, which leads to either one partner being in a parental role that they didn't truly want or one partner feeling resentful about losing their chance at parenthood. The final possibility is that both partners, recognizing the irreconcilability of their differences, are honest with themselves and each other and break up. I doubt that you or your partner want option number 2. That leaves the two of you to figure out whether you're truly on the same page about having kids (or whether there's a reasonable chance of that in the near-ish future)  or whether it might be time to part ways.

That being said, of course, this doesn't imply that you should rush the decision. Parenthood is such a huge responsibility that hesitation and reflection is a completely natural and, in many cases, necessary course of action. After a certain point, though, a non-answer becomes an answer. Not making a decision is the decision. I would suggest that the two of you have an open, honest conversation about your potential timeline for having children. Not so you can pressure him into becoming a parent or give him an ultimatum, but rather to remind him that the two of you don't have forever to make this decision, and after a certain point, if you truly want children and he doesn’t, then the relationship will no longer be tenable. After all, this isn't one of those situations where you can compromise. Either you have at least one child with your partner, or you don't. There’s no “half a child.” 

I know that still sounds like an ultimatum, but you can begin by grounding the conversation in openness rather than urgency. Try saying: “I’m feeling a clearer sense of what I want, and I need to understand where you are so we can navigate this together.” This signals that you’re not demanding a decision on the spot but it also implies that you are not willing to wait this out indefinitely.

Then dig into what “uncertainty” means for him. Is he unsure about the timing? His readiness? The idea of parenthood itself? Uncertainty has many shades, and clarity will help both of you understand whether you’re facing hesitation or a deeper ambivalence. After all, sometimes ambivalence reflects genuine uncertainty about something, whereas other times it's really a “no” in nicer clothing. You need to figure out which one it is, and if it's the former, what is the core cause of the uncertainty?

At the same time, articulate your own timeline without apology. You’re not issuing an ultimatum by acknowledging that your desires matter. You’re simply saying: “I can’t stay indefinitely in a holding pattern. I want to explore this with you in a way that respects both of our needs.” Without naming a specific time in the future by which he needs to make his decision, you're clearly communicating to him that the status quo of uncertainty cannot continue forever.

Finally, agree on a structured follow-up—a real check-in a few weeks or months down the line. “Sweetheart, I know that we've talked about having kids at some point, and I know that last time we checked in you were hesitant. But has your stance changed at all since the last time that we talked?” Big decisions often require reflection, but they also require momentum. You’re not rushing him. You’re creating a shared path forward. But you're also gently letting him know that at a certain point, there will be a fork in the road, and that he will need to decide which of the two paths to take.

QUESTION: My husband’s best friend recently confided in me that he’s struggling with depression, and he begged me not to tell my husband because he “doesn’t want to be a burden.” I care about this person, but I’m not comfortable holding a secret this big—especially since my husband would want to support him. I don’t want to betray his trust, but I also don’t want to shoulder something I’m not qualified to manage. What’s the right way to navigate this?

ANSWER: Situations like this are tricky and require clear boundaries. You are caught between protecting the friend's confidence and your own hesitation at carrying a secret that you really shouldn't have to carry. You should make clear to the friend that he should reach out to other people who are better able to assist him. Begin by validating his feelings. “I’m really glad you trusted me enough to share this.” Then pivot gently toward your boundary: “But I’m not the right person to carry this alone. You deserve support from people who love you, and I can’t hold this in isolation.”

Encourage him to tell your husband directly. Offer support if he wants help framing the conversation. Men are notoriously hesitant to share sensitive things like this with other men, which is probably why he told you instead of your husband directly. But telling your husband would be a much more appropriate choice, since after all, his best friend is your husband, not you. Make an offer to the friend that helps to break down these self-imposed male barriers regarding hard topics. “I think it would be good for you to talk with him. If you want, I can sit with you when you tell him.” This takes a lot of the pressure off of him and makes it not just a man-to-man encounter, but also an encounter including you. Gender matters a lot in these types of situations, but it doesn't have to be an insurmountable barrier against getting help.

If he still refuses to tell your husband, you may need to prioritize safety over secrecy. Mental health struggles are not casual confidences. You need to be firm but non-threatening with the friend that this isn't something he can just tell you and then pretend like nothing is going on. You might say: “I’m worried about you, and I can’t keep this from him if it means you won’t get the support you need.” 

This isn’t betrayal. It’s responsible care. You’re not exposing him. You’re preventing him from collapsing alone under the weight of something he shouldn’t have to carry in silence.

QUESTION: I’m close with my older sister, but she’s been sharing very personal details about my life with extended family members—things I told her in confidence. When I confronted her, she said she was “just trying to help people understand what I’m going through.” I’m hurt and feel exposed, but she doesn’t seem to grasp the breach of trust. How do I rebuild safety with someone who doesn’t seem to understand boundaries?

ANSWER: People violate others' confidence for a variety of reasons, but it's never acceptable except in very specific circumstances, such as if the person poses a harm to themselves or others. And it doesn't sound like these circumstances apply in your case. The fact that you've already confronted her and made clear what the problem is, and that she doesn't seem willing or able to change her behavior, indicates a larger issue. You will have to make clear to her the gravity of the situation, and if necessary, stop sharing sensitive personal information with her if the behavior continues.

Start with clarity: “When I share personal things with you, I expect them to stay between us unless I explicitly say otherwise.” Don’t soften it into a suggestion. Frame it as the baseline requirement for trust. Then explain the emotional impact: “When you share my private information, I feel exposed and misunderstood. It makes me hesitate to open up at all.” If she offers a rationalization, such as, "I'm just trying to help people understand your circumstances," push back. “I understand you mean well, but this information is not yours to share. If I want other loved ones to be privy to this information, then I will share it myself. Please trust that I have the judgment to be able to do this.”

From there, set a forward-looking rule: “If you’re ever unsure whether something is private, assume it is. Ask me first before sharing it with anyone else.” With anything that's at all sensitive, she needs to ask you before sharing it. End of discussion.

If she still minimizes your concern, stay steady: “Intentions aside, the impact is real. I need this boundary respected.”

Rebuilding trust takes time, but consistency helps. If she proves she can hold confidentiality moving forward, the relationship will strengthen. If she can’t, then you will know that you simply can't share private or sensitive information with her anymore. Not out of punishment, but in order to protect yourself. Love doesn't justify allowing your sister to become a sieve with your most private and intimate information.

QUESTION: My partner recently disclosed that he’s been feeling lost about his career, and now he wants to explore a totally different field. I want to be supportive, but I’m anxious—this could mean years of retraining, financial instability, and a major shift in our future plans. I don’t want to discourage him, but I also don’t want to ignore the practical impact on our shared life. How do I support his growth without sidelining my own needs?

ANSWER: Career changes often mean more than simply a new way to make money. They often also involve shifts in our sense of identity or a response to long-standing frustrations. In other words, they are often quite personal. You want to validate your partner's explorations of this new field, but you're also understandably concerned about its implications for both of your lives. Underlying all of this is the uncertainty surrounding what will happen over the next few years, both in his professional life and by extension, in your lives more generally.

You should convey to him both of these things: validation but also concern over the uncertainty. Begin by validating the courage it takes to consider a big change: “I admire that you’re thinking deeply about your future.” Then shift into partnership mode: “Let’s talk about what this might mean for us, both emotionally and practically.”

When I underwent a career change a decade ago, it involved a lot of complex emotions. Such is probably the case with him as well. So if he is eager to share the reasons for his career change, such as excitement over the possibility of a fresh start or frustrations in his current career, then hear him out. Simply listening will probably mean a lot to him, and it would also make it more likely for him to listen to you in turn when you express your concerns. It's also important to keep in mind cognitive biases. Even for the most sober-minded and careful people, the prospect of a career change often leads to distorted thinking where we romanticize our prospective new career with respect to the career that we're in now. But you can help to gently "reel him in" when he does this without coming across as though you're trying to crush his dreams.

If he doesn't volunteer this information, ask questions that clarify the scope: What draws him to the new field? What steps would he need to take? What timeline is realistic? This isn’t interrogation; it’s co-planning. If he pushes back, remind him that he would surely want to know the same information if you were considering a career change. Make sure that you thoroughly discuss aspects of the career change that would most affect your shared life. Would the career change require both of you to relocate? How much, realistically, would any retraining cost? And how long would it take, in a reasonable estimate, from the day of graduation until he starts earning the salary that he did in the job that he is now considering leaving? What does this all look like for retirement and other aspects of your shared financial life?

Name your own concerns without framing them as obstacles: “I want to make sure we’re honoring both of our needs. Stability matters to me, and I need to understand how this transition would fit into our life.”

Career changes are multi-stage processes, and the two of you might work together to decide upon a phased approach to this transition. One in which the first steps would be somewhat experimental and relatively easily reversed. He can start by simply researching the new field, which is probably what he's doing now. This can involve talking to established professionals in this field, reading articles and websites, etc. And if he's able to, he can shadow professionals in the field as well. The next step might involve more commitment, such as part-time classes, depending on the target career. If the field he's aspiring to is one with a very rigid and pre-set course of study, such as the law, then he might sit in on one or two classes if he's able to. This approach could allow him to test the path before making a full leap.

All in all, you’re not denying him growth. You’re ensuring that your relationship with him is woven into his career change decision rather than left behind.

QUESTION: My partner and I have different approaches to religious traditions. I grew up celebrating holidays with specific rituals that still feel meaningful to me. He didn’t grow up with those traditions and doesn’t feel connected to them. When the holidays come, he participates politely but without enthusiasm. I feel oddly lonely celebrating something that matters deeply to me while he seems indifferent. How do we bridge this emotional gap?

ANSWER: From your letter, this seems like more of a problem regarding traditions than religious differences. The distinction matters. The former type of problem is usually more solvable, as it's typically a lot easier to participate in traditions meaningfully or even to create your own traditions than it is to adopt a new religious identity wholesale. One can derive meaning from traditions, even if they don't believe in the underlying faith. It sounds from your letter as though what matters to you is that he participate in these traditions without just going through the motions, as opposed to believing all of the underlying doctrine. This is certainly lower-hanging fruit than trying to blend religious identities among partners or determining a single religious identity for an interfaith couple. I'm going to write the rest of my response on the assumption that this is more of a tradition issue than a religion issue.

I've known a lot of people who are not particularly religious, but can still find meaning in some religious traditions. For example, some of my most treasured memories are participating in Christmas Eve celebrations at my uncle's and aunt's church, singing along, and feeling a sense of joy and community even though I have never actually believed in Christian doctrine. I even remember fondly the hot candle wax burning my little hands during the celebration. (We used real candles back then.) So is there similarly a way in which your partner can find meaning in the traditions you've been raised in? There are many “hooks in” to religious traditions for those not raised in faith, or in the same faith. Do you think he could put forth more effort in practicing some of your traditions in the name of community or connection with you and your family or a love of music, for instance? Unless you feel strongly otherwise, you can also emphasize to him that the main importance of his meaningful participation in these traditions is in their connection with you and your past, as opposed to believing in a particular doctrine.

Start by sharing the emotional significance: “These traditions are tied to my sense of family and identity. When I celebrate them alone, even with you present, something feels missing.” Then ask what parts of the rituals he might connect with—not for religious reasons, but relational ones. Maybe he can choose one element to adopt as “ours,” creating meaning through shared intention rather than inherited symbolism. Growing up, I'm sure that your family put their own "stamp" on the religious traditions that you all practice. Maybe you and your partner can do the same.

At the same time, make clear that you don't expect him to feel exactly the same way about your traditions as you do. “I understand you didn't grow up with these traditions, and that's totally fine. I’m not asking you to pretend as though you did;  I don’t need you to feel what I feel. I just want us to create a way of celebrating that feels participatory rather than polite.” Hopefully that plants a seed that convinces him to more carefully consider what these rituals mean to you and how he might find meaning in them as well. 

Blended traditions evolve slowly. You’re not asking him to convert. You’re asking him to co-create a ritual landscape that honors both histories.

QUESTION: My friend is extremely committed to a cause she cares about, but lately every discussion feels like activism. If I express any uncertainty, she treats it as a moral lapse. I support the cause too, but the intensity is exhausting. How do I maintain the friendship without feeling like every conversation is a test?

ANSWER: Especially in the current political climate, activists on both sides are particularly passionate. Both sides also frequently impose “purity tests” and ostracize those who are deemed to have failed. And laypeople and activists alike often see every issue as existential. I'm not saying your friend is actually engaging in these actions, but rather I'm just reminding you of all this to illustrate the larger context in which your friend is operating. This doesn't justify her behavior, but it can help you understand it better. If one cares deeply about a cause, then it can be easy to fall into the trap of thinking that everyone must be equally passionate about the cause. This is especially true if, as I assume is the case with your friend, she's part of a larger community of activists. In an activist mentality, one can easily forget that other people are complex and may not share the same views. And that if they don't share the same views, that doesn't necessarily mean they are morally deficient.

This situation requires clear boundaries that you need to set with your friend. You need to explain to her that while you also support her cause, you're choosing to not put as much time and effort into it as she is, and she needs to be okay with that. Shift the focus from ideology to your connection to her. Say, “I care about this cause too, but when every conversation becomes a debate, I feel more evaluated than understood. I want us to be able to talk as friends, not as adversaries or as political mentors and apprentices.”

You might also remind her that you also have passions and strong interests, but you're not asking her to devote her life to them. “Peggy, I love crocheting and programming, but I'm not asking you to constantly drop everything and become an expert crocheter or become the next Bill Gates.” And if she pushes back that that’s different because her cause is more morally urgent, then remind her that we each get to decide how much effort to put into the things we care about, and that if one chooses to spend their time crocheting rather than marching in the streets, that doesn't make them a bad person or apathetic towards injustice. “I also care deeply about women's rights, but I'm not able or willing to go to every march or to send donations to every activist program as a result. You need to accept that these are my decisions, and it doesn't mean that I'm a bad person or don't care about women's rights.”

Set a conversational boundary without discrediting her passion. “I’m open to discussing this sometimes, but I can’t have it be the only lens we connect through.” A genuine friend will understand the distinction between limiting a topic and rejecting a value. If she interprets your boundary as betrayal, the friendship may need some distance until she can relate in more than one register and can respect your choices. 

Caring for someone and sharing their interest in a cause doesn't mean accepting their harsh moral judgments or letting every conversation with them revolve around their pet issue.

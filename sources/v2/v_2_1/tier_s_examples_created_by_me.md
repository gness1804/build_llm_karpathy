QUESTION: I was in what I thought was a long-term, loving relationship for over a year. My partner, "J", and I shared a lot of interests, got along mostly well, and overall really connected. We had even started talking about marriage, although only semi-seriously. But then J goes on a business trip for two weeks. On his last day, he calls me and says that he needs to take some time for himself. I thought, This is odd, but if he needs his space for a while and to recharge, then I'm all for it. But after this conversation, he dropped off the face of the earth. No calls, texts, e-mails. I called and texted him multiple times to try to understand what's going on, but I was continually met with silence. 

After two agonizing months of no contact from him at all, he calls me out of the blue one evening. He says he wants to pick up where we left off. I'm incensed. I gave him a piece of my mind and let him know that it's not acceptable to ghost your partner like that, especially given the level of commitment that I thought we had had. We had a big fight, and I told him that I never wanted to see him again. (I should note that I did ask him whether something tragic or drastic had happened, such as one of his parents passing away, and he said no, there was nothing like that. He didn't give a real explanation.) But now looking back, I feel guilty. Did I overreact?

ANSWER: Anyone who invests a year in a relationship, openly discusses marriage, and then gets cut off without warning would be shaken. A year together is a major emotional investment. When someone disappears at that stage, people often experience a kind of emotional disorientation—guilt, shame, confusion, and, very often, self-doubt. But it’s important to remember that he was the one who chose to walk out, and his choice reflects on him, not on your worth. You weren’t being overly dramatic. You were responding like any person would when a trusted partner suddenly vanishes.

A year together signals seriousness for most people. By that point, ending things by text already feels too abrupt and impersonal, let alone disappearing entirely. Ghosting after that level of intimacy isn’t a momentary lapse in judgment. It’s a deep breakdown in basic relational responsibility.

If he reaches out again hoping to reopen the conversation, you can keep your response simple:
"I'm not interested in revisiting this. You disappeared for two months without explanation, and I can't overlook that. I've moved on. I wish you well, but I'm not available for further contact."

That isn't punishment. It’s a boundary.

It’s also worth remembering that two months is a sixth of your entire relationship and longer than many relationships last in total. You deserve someone who honors your time and your presence instead of leaving for an extended period and returning only when it’s convenient for him. If working through all of this brings up self-doubt or lingering guilt, a therapist can be a helpful partner in making sense of what happened—not because you did anything wrong, but because experiences like this can shake your sense of stability. A good therapist can help you internalize that this rupture was about his avoidance, not your value, and sometimes hearing that clearly and consistently is the best medicine as you move forward.

QUESTION: My boyfriend of a year and a half broke up with me last month. Like most breakups, it wasn't pleasant. Our issues were multiple: we didn't see eye-to-eye on finances. He was more religious than me and was becoming dissatisfied that I didn't want to convert to his faith. I didn't get along well with parts of his family and a few other things. I realize that you and most advice columnists would probably see these as a big deal, and I mean they are, I admit that. But the frustrating thing is, when it was just the two of us watching Netflix or eating dinner or just talking, it felt magical. During those moments, I felt that we really did have a long-term future together. But I suppose the cliché is true: love alone isn't enough.

At least he had the courage to end things in person. We went to our favorite restaurant, and as we were finishing dinner, he told me he had something to tell me. He explained that while he loves me and I will always have a part of his heart, at our core we just aren't compatible. He cited some issues I mentioned above. I was very hurt, but I acknowledged his right to end things. After all, all relationships have to be mutual.

After that dinner, I moved out, and I've been living with my sister until I can find a place to live alone again. The reason I'm writing to you is that I still really want closure, but he doesn't seem interested. I want to know what I could have done differently, and I have some questions for him concerning how we might have been able to resolve some of our differences, like in terms of finance and family. I feel that he did not fully explain his reasons for ending things, and I didn't get closure as a result. I feel he left me hanging when it came to some of the particulars. Am I right to feel this way? Is there a way that I can get closure from him, or should I just drop this?

ANSWER: The hardest breakups, and the ones that often leave us with the most questions, are usually the ones where nobody did anything “wrong.” When a relationship ends this way, it’s common to feel blindsided, especially after investing a year and a half of your life. Wanting a fuller explanation isn’t a sign that you’re stuck or unreasonable; it’s a very human attempt to make sense of a meaningful loss.

The desire for closure is rooted in a powerful need to create a narrative around painful events. Without one, it’s easy to get caught in a loop of unanswered questions and imagined alternatives. But people process breakups differently. Some want to talk everything through, while others need distance to move on. Neither approach is inherently wrong, but when those needs don’t align, there often isn’t a satisfying middle ground. In situations like this, unless there’s some unusual or unresolved circumstance, continuing to press for answers usually prolongs the pain rather than easing it.

If you feel the urge to text or call him in search of closure, it can help to pause and tell yourself something like: “This relationship ended, and it hurts. I may never know every detail of what he was thinking, and that’s okay. Sometimes the fit just isn’t there, and I don’t need a complete explanation in order to heal or move forward.” That isn’t resignation; it’s self-protection.

Instead of anchoring your healing to an explanation he may never be willing or able to give, try grounding yourself in what you already know. The differences you described—around finances, religion, and family—are substantial, and any one of them is enough to end a relationship, let alone all of them combined. And regardless of how things ended, you’re still you: someone worthy of love, compatibility, and stability.

What you're going through is common, but I know that doesn't make it hurt any less. If you find yourself stuck in self-doubt or rumination, a therapist can be a helpful partner in sorting through those feelings. Learning to let your own understanding, rather than someone else’s explanation, carry the weight of your healing is not only less emotionally risky; it’s also far more empowering.

QUESTION: My brother has a good friend who he seems to have a love-hate relationship with. The friend is less "conventionally successful" than my brother. For instance, while my brother has multiple advanced degrees and a six-figure job, the friend has "only" a bachelor's degree and a job that pays tens of thousands of dollars less than my brother's. (I say "only" a bachelor's degree not to minimize that achievement, but just to try to create more context, hence the quotes around the word.) My brother also has a group of tech friends that he hangs out with (he works in the tech industry), and I think he gets a lot out of being around people who he sees as closer to his success level. My brother is also married, for what it's worth, while his friend is in what the friend himself admits is a dead marriage. Long story, but for our purposes, it's another status mismatch between the two.

My brother pays lip service to not caring about these superficial factors, but his actions tell a different story. My brother always talks about hanging out with the friend begrudgingly, as if it's a chore or obligation he has to do, like going to the supermarket. And my brother is always trying to postpone or shorten their gatherings. The friend never seems to mind. Whether that's out of otherworldly emotional restraint and perspective, or desperation, or something else, I'm not sure. The friend has always struggled socially, while my brother, even though he's had his own issues, has generally done better.

Is it wrong of me to consider talking to my brother about this? I mean, his friendships really should be his business, but it hurts to see him treating his friend like this. Is that my place to talk with him about this? Or is this something I should just let go?

ANSWER: It must be quite painful to see your own brother engaging in actions that harm others. You clearly care about the friend and your brother. So you're not wrong to feel hurt even though your brother's actions aren't directed at you. You don't mention that there's been any outright abuse in this friendship. Had there been, the case for intervention would have been a slam dunk. Assuming no abuse, this is a tough nut to crack. You want your brother to treat his friend better, but you also don't want to get involved in his life. You respect his autonomy as I'm sure you would want him to respect yours. But yet you also see him engaging in actions that violate your moral compass.

But that being said, I think this issue is more complex than just your brother's autonomy vs. compassion. This is a situation where you don't have to speak up right away, unprovoked (again, if there was abuse, then the advice would be very different). But the next time the topic of the friend comes up, and especially if your brother says something dismissive towards him, then you might want to speak up. You might say something like the following: "[Brother], I know that your friendships are your own business, but as your sister and as a friend, I can't help but notice that you've been treating your friend a bit dismissively. This conveys to the friend that you don't think that he's worthy of your time. Would you like to be treated like that?"

Such a conversation might be hard, but if your brother is open-minded and willing to reconsider his attitudes, then that will help far more people than just his friend. Being reminded of where we're falling short when it comes to compassion and empathy can help us grow in ways that benefit us all. And if he pushes back or chooses not to engage, you can still take some peace in knowing that you spoke up in a way that was measured, compassionate, and aligned with your values. Sometimes doing that is all that’s within our control, and sometimes that’s enough.

QUESTION: I recently ended things with my girlfriend, and now I regret having done so. It's always easy to idealize somebody after a breakup, but in this case, she really was the total package: kind, compassionate, very smart, and seemed to really love me. So why did I let her go? Because of family pressure. 

Our family has always focused on academic achievement. In my immediate family alone, there are two doctors, a lawyer, and an accountant. I myself am a professor at a mid-sized regional university. I was raised to believe in the value of education. Unfortunately, in our case, this too often veered into perfectionism. And even worse, into mistreatment or dismissal of others who didn't meet our lofty academic standards. 

My ex is a social worker with "only" an undergrad degree from a state school. She also had always done well in school, but it wasn't her life. She cared more about improving the world and other passions like art. That's a major reason why I fell for her, but it's also why my family never truly accepted her. Sometimes they paid lip service to accepting her, but more often they would make snarky comments behind her back about how she didn't measure up or how she wasn't "Yale material." Those comments affected me more than I thought. Last month, I found myself telling her that we just weren't a good fit. I never really explained why, but she was smart enough to figure it out. She said something to the effect of, "Well, if you think you're too good for me, then I never want to see you again." Which I deserved.

I sorely regret ending things. Is there a way back into her life? Or even failing that, should I simply reach out to her to apologize? It's been a few weeks, and we haven't talked since that conversation. We didn't live together or have kids or anything, so it was a relatively easy split logistically. But emotionally, I'm still tied in knots. Help?

ANSWER: You were clearly caught between a woman you loved and a family that possesses a narrow definition of success in life. And now you regret having listened to your family rather than honoring your own feelings and those of the person that you were with. It was an awful situation, and I'm sorry you had to go through it. But it seems like a hard lesson in what not to do when faced with conflict between family expectations and what your heart is telling you.

I would not attempt further contact with her. You ended things. She made it clear she didn't want to interact with you anymore. And even though you didn't respect her life choices during the relationship, you should at least respect her choice now to end contact with you. If by chance she does reach out to you, which would probably be for logistical reasons rather than any interest in renewing your relationship, do not attempt to win her back. You can tell her something like, "I'm so sorry for how I treated you. I don't expect you to forgive me, and I certainly don't expect you to take me back. But I just wanted to express that I feel awful for having treated you so poorly. You didn't deserve that, and I didn't deserve you." And mean it.

If she doesn't reach out, don't reach out to her. You seem wracked with guilt and a strong need to apologize to her. But reaching out would probably do more harm than good, especially since she expressed the wish to not see you again. And she would likely take an unsolicited apology as an empty gesture meant more to comfort you than to sincerely atone for the mistakes that you made and the hurt that you caused. Guilt can be a useful signal to us to do better. Now that you're more aware of how others' opinions can sway you and of some of your own blind spots, you'll be better equipped for future relationships. Let this person go. Do better next time.

QUESTION: I briefly dated a woman last year. Let's call her "Jeannie." And by "briefly," I mean: friendship that quickly evolved, romance that developed even more quickly, a brief sexual encounter, and then painful disengagement on the part of Jeannie. The situation was short but extremely intense, and it was one of the one or two times that I've truly been in love. We were good friends for 6 months after our "breakup" and then have remained cordial thereafter. 

After the romantic liaison with Jeannie ended, I met another woman. She was very different from Jeannie, was more stable and critically, she didn't run away when things got tough. I have been in a serious relationship with this other woman, "Mira," for about a year at this point. We have a good relationship.

Jeannie wants to remain friends. The romantic aspect of our relationship is clearly dead, and neither of us has any interest in reviving it. And my relationship with Jeannie ended before my current relationship started. So I have no problem remaining friends. But Mira says it's inappropriate to remain friends with an ex, particularly someone I was with so recently. There's no beef with Jeannie, but she thinks I should cut off contact in the name of our relationship. I'm not happy with this response. I've never cheated on anyone in my life and have no plans to do so. Who's right?

ANSWER: Being torn between two people you care about, especially when you don't think that there's a valid reason for the conflict to be there at all, is definitely a distinct kind of pain. In your mind, there's a clear boundary, chronologically and physically, that separates your relationship with Jeannie from that with Mira. Mira feels differently. 

Being friends with an ex is one of those age-old issues dividing good, thoughtful people. One school of thought holds that such a friendship, or indeed any friendship between people with the potential for mutual attraction, is almost always a slippery slope towards inappropriate contact between the two people involved. Call this the "When Harry Met Sally" school. The other camp is more permissive of such friendships, as long as appropriate boundaries are maintained. And at the end of the day, it really does depend on the people and the circumstances. I've known of people who were platonic friends with exes for years after the breakup, with no apparent rekindling of any sort of romantic interest between them. And I've also known of people who, um, went the "When Harry Met Sally" route.

Ultimately, the answer to this question depends on the particulars. What are your partner's reasons for not being comfortable with you continuing to remain friends with this ex? How would you feel if the situation were reversed and she were platonic friends with a guy she had dated previously? You have a right to your own friendships, but her concerns are also valid. If you truly feel that you can maintain a friendship with this ex without any temptations or risk of inappropriate actions, then it might be worth trying to make the friendship work--while also keeping your current partner apprised, of course. Suggest a compromise. For instance, maybe only hang out with Jeannie in group settings or when your partner is there. Or agree to only see Jeannie in public spaces during the day. But if your partner's discomfort would seem to preclude even compromises like this, then you might have to weigh this friendship vs. your current relationship. If it really does seem to be a mutually exclusive choice after ruling out compromises and such, then you'll have to decide whether staying in your current relationship is worth cutting ties with a friend or vice-versa.

QUESTION: My wife and I are facing a quandary concerning faith. When we met, we were at a somewhat different place regarding religion, but we felt that we were basically compatible. Long story short, she believes in God, I don't, but we both have the same basic values. I let her know of my leanings early on, and she was always accepting. She comes from a very religious family, but questions many aspects of organized religions, particularly the one that she was raised in. We went through a rough patch with her parents accepting me because of the religious issues, but we moved beyond that.

Now, however, we seem to be moving in opposite directions. If you can imagine a 0-to-10 scale with respect to warmth towards religion, with 0 being completely cold to religion and 10 being extremely accepting, as of this time a year ago, I was probably about a 4 while she was a 6 or 7. But now she's probably an 8 or a 9, while I'm a 2. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is the current political climate in this country, I'm feeling even more turned off by religion than I was a year or two ago. But at the same time, she's interested in re-exploring the faith she grew up in. She's even singing in a church choir and has been for a few months. Recently, I saw a cross which had been banished to our garage, now in our guest bedroom on the bed.

How can we accommodate this difference? We haven't had any arguments over it yet, but I feel that there's some tension. I want to respect her faith and her own spiritual decisions, but my allergic reaction to religion makes that difficult. How can we both coexist under the same roof with different attitudes towards religion?

ANSWER: Religious differences can be particularly painful because they often involve not only abstract belief but also matters of identity, family, and morality. And when one feels that a fragile equilibrium in their life is disrupted, it's often unsettling. Particularly when that fragile equilibrium was perceived to protect them from something that's long been triggering. But it sounds like you and your wife are both coming from a place of compassion and respect. That matters a great deal. 

This will position you better to explore the thorny issues your letter raises. I would sit down with her and have a calm, respectful conversation regarding your religious differences. Mention that you've observed her re-embracing the faith that she grew up in. Don't express judgment or condemnation. Then give your side of the story--that religion is still triggering for you and you need a certain degree of space from it. You might even remind her of one or two examples, if you can keep from turning it into a laundry list of grievances. You might say something like, "Honey, I know that we have differences in opinion regarding religion and its place in our lives. But I want us to come to a solution that honors and respects both of us, our shared space, and our respective mental and emotional health. What are your suggestions?"

Such a conversation is important because ultimately, a compromise will be needed here. Maybe she can place the cross in a room that only she mostly uses. Maybe you agree to attend services with her once or twice a month when her choir is singing. And these services need not all be in person. Many churches now offer hybrid services; that is, services both online and in-person. If she's amenable to it, maybe you can agree to an arrangement like you attending church once a month when she's singing, and for the rest of the services, you watch virtually. This could be a way of supporting her without being in the triggering environment as much. And, of course, she should agree to give you the space to explore your own philosophy and ideas without judgment. There are many secular groups in many parts of the country such as the Ethical Society, humanist groups, and atheist groups. I have known multiple non-religious people who have found much of the same community and sense of purpose in these groups as many others do in churches, but without the beliefs or rituals that they find problematic.

By marrying into a religious family, apparently you're already accommodating religion to a certain extent. Remember also that making these accommodations for your wife doesn't imply that you believe what she does or vice versa. Making modest accommodations for each other isn't surrender. It's displaying love and respect. And ultimately, that's what life should be all about, whether or not one is devout.

QUESTION: My dad and I have a complex relationship. Growing up, my household was fairly traditional. He was the main breadwinner, my mother stayed at home during most of my childhood, and he had very traditional attitudes about who should be in charge of the household. On the plus side, he provided for us well financially. He was able to give three kids a materially comfortable childhood and then send all of those kids to college without them owing a dime in debt, all with a mostly non-working spouse. An achievement that neither I nor most others in my generation would be able to replicate. And he was always there for my sports practices and taught me a lot about work ethic. On the negative side of the ledger, he had serious problems with anger. He was unable to control his anger, and that frequently made the house a terrifying place to live in. He never physically abused us aside from spanking, which is seen as abuse in some quarters. But he would often erupt at the smallest provocation and would do things like destroy my toy planes that he and I had built together when I was a small child. He made it clear that we should live in fear of him. All of us, including my mom, walked on eggshells. 

Now I'm in my 40s. I don't have kids of my own partly due to my own difficult childhood. But I am married, and I try every day to treat my spouse and others differently than my father treated us. Now my father is in his mid-70s. Given his family's historical longevity, he has maybe ten years left. Perhaps add one or three for modern medical advances that weren't around when his own parents were in their last years. My dilemma is whether I should confront him about what happened long ago. I feel that confronting him might give me a sense of closure if I make clear that what he did wasn't okay, and that he should at least acknowledge it, if not apologize for it. And I worry that if I don't talk to him about it within the next few years, then I will forever lose my chance to do so and forever regret it. Another part of me says that I probably wouldn't get an apology from him anyway, and that pursuing one is just a recipe for emotional disappointment. That would compound the pain he inflicted even more. What should I do?

ANSWER: When somebody you love hurts you deeply, it often leaves scars that last for a long time. Many people feel the need to try to close these wounds by confronting the person who caused them. But in any situation, not just this one, conditioning healing or closure upon somebody else's approval or apology is setting ourselves up for painful disappointment.

A recurring theme in this and other advice columns is boundaries. That is, setting appropriate boundaries for people who cause harm, be it intentional or otherwise. In your particular case, though, the tragedy is that children can't really set boundaries in the same way that adults can. They lack the power to do so. So your father's constant violations of reasonable boundaries in your household, against you and your siblings and your mother, happened apparently unimpeded. At this point, the boundary that you now have the power to set is with your own expectations. I would not recommend reaching out to him if the purpose is to gain an apology or otherwise get closure from him. Considering he's not reached out to you about this in all these years, all these decades, it's unlikely he'll be receptive to your message now. Confronting him directly would likely reopen old wounds without giving you what you want.

I would recommend a more introspective approach. Write him a letter you know he will never read because you will never give it to him. In this letter, don't pull punches. Don't hold back. Tell him exactly how his actions make you feel, how they hurt you, and what you want from him now. In many cases, people find that this exercise enables them to defuse a lot of pain and emotional tension, and it reduces their urge to confront the person for real. And if you aren't already, you might also consider working with a therapist to help you process some of these issues. Your dad's treatment of you was definitely not okay, but you don't need to compound the pain by hoping for a closure that probably will never come. Your past self deserved better, and you deserve better now.

QUESTION: Growing up, my sister was always the favorite child. There are two of us, and she's the older one by two and a half years. Consistently, as we went through school and then started our adult lives, our parents would pay more attention to her than to me. Let's call her Rosie. My parents would praise Rosie's grades much more than mine, even though we usually brought home similar report cards throughout our schooling. Rosie also participated in several sports, including swimming, while I leaned towards more academically oriented extracurriculars. Our parents attended almost every one of her athletic events and would give her high praise, even when she or her team didn't do well. By contrast, whenever I would win an academic bowl or a forensics tournament, our parents might give an off-handed "good job" at best. Usually they didn't even seem to notice. 

This is continued into adulthood. When Rosie's first child was born a few years ago, her parents were overjoyed. As one might expect at the birth of a first grandchild, or really any grandchild. They showered her with presents and praise and offered to do whatever she needed when it came to babysitting, etc. (We live only about an hour away from our parents.) But now, I'm expecting my first child, and our parents seem almost like they don't care. They congratulated me at first when I told them the news, but they haven't bestowed anywhere near the attention on me that they did on Rosie during her pregnancy. I shudder to think what will happen once my child is born. I fear that my parents will replicate their dysfunctional favoritism to the next generation, such that my children might start to feel resentful or less than because of their grandparents' behavior. My husband and I have sworn that we would never do that to our children, that we would treat them equally and not engage in favoritism. So we certainly don’t want the grandparents replicating their mistakes with the next generation. 

Do you think I should keep grandparents at bay after our children are born? Rosie and I already have a fairly distant relationship, mostly because of what happened as children. I don't want my children to grow up feeling that their worth is any less than anybody else's just because their grandparents can't figure out how to treat children equally. But I do want them to have a meaningful and rich relationship with their grandparents, especially since my own relationship with mine was mine. How should we handle this?

ANSWER: I think that most parents worry about the perpetuation of dysfunctional patterns onto their own children. This is especially true when the issue is parental favoritism. Favoritism can create emotional scars and ruptures that last a lifetime. It teaches children that some are more worthy of love than others and it erodes sibling bonds by pitting children against each other in a brutal contest for parental favor. It can also harm the favored child by creating a sense of entitlement and a sense that actions don't have consequences or, at least, consequences that are as severe as for other people. I've seen this a lot in my own life. But I'm sure you intuitively know all this already. In your case, it seems like you're torn between the hope of keeping your parents in your future kids' lives while not wanting them to be negatively affected by what your parents inflicted on you. That's a tough place to be in. But I also worry that you're reacting to problems that haven't happened yet, however likely it seems that they will in the future. 

I would take the approach of "trust but verify." Assume good intentions from the grandparents until you see evidence otherwise. At the same time, don't be naive. Try to be there as much as you can when the grandparents are over so that you can observe how they interact with your kids. If you observe problematic behavior, intervene. Pull your parents aside and say something like: “Mom and Dad, my children and I love you. But when we see you exercising favoritism for Rosie's children over mine, such as [Examples A and B], it sends the wrong message to both sets of children. Can you work on treating all of your grandchildren more equally in the future?”

If they won't play ball, limit your children's interaction with your parents. And if this keeps happening, you might want to make the hard decision to keep your children separate from their grandparents until the grandparents express a genuine wish to treat their grandchildren more fairly, and then you see evidence of this. It would be heartbreaking to have to explain to your children why they don't get to see their grandparents very often. But the emotional harm that your grandparents will cause if they play the same favoritism game with their grandchildren outweighs this concern. Ultimately, you might have to end up doing for your parents what they failed to do for you and your sister: modeling an equitable approach to children. Love alone can't justify knowingly subjecting your children to cruel and arbitrary treatment.

QUESTION: I'm 15. My parents are going through a nasty divorce. I won't bore you with the details, but they are using me as a go-between. My father is living in an apartment with his new girlfriend, so cliche. And I'm at home with my mother. Since the court hasn't ruled yet, our family is working out visitation practices on the fly. For example, I spent last weekend with my dad, and he also got to see me Wednesday and Thursday of the week before that. There's no rhyme or reason to it. 

But that's small potatoes compared with the main problem. My parents don't seem to be capable of speaking to each other unless they are yelling. My mother will often ask me to “tell your father that I will be dropping off his clothes at such-and-such time.” My father might tell me something like, “Ask your mother why she won't set our court date yet and also why she's being such a bitch.” I’m sorry to use that word, but it's important for context. They are also constantly bad-mouthing each other to me behind their backs and clearly want me to side with one over the other. This is devastating to me.

I don't want to be my parents' messenger pigeon. I want them both to love me equally, and I want to have a good relationship with both. I don't want to have to choose between them. Is this going to be my life for the rest of their days, or is there some way out of this?

ANSWER: I’m so sorry that you have to go through that. No child deserves to be treated as a go-between by their parents. And no child should be forced into the heartbreaking position of having to choose one parent over the other. This is not only deeply unfair, but it also teaches children to be perpetually wary of those who are supposed to love them the most, lest their trust be betrayed again. It teaches children terrible lessons about communication, basic decency, and how to "fight fair" with a spouse or partner, including during a breakup or divorce.

I know all this sounds scary. But the good news is that you do have some tools at your disposal. And you seem to have a good head on your shoulders. The road ahead will be hard, but there are ways to lighten the burden.

You can start by having a difficult but important conversation with your parents, presumably separately. You might tell them, for instance, to not insult the other and to not try to get you to pick sides. You can encourage them to talk to the other parent directly whenever possible. If you need a “script,” then you can say something like the following: “I love you. But when you fight with [Other Parent], it hurts me a lot. I want to feel loved and accepted by both of you, and I don't want to feel that you are using me to get back at the other person. Can you please stop making me choose between you and [Other Parent]?”

There are also resources out there to help you, and I encourage you to take advantage of them. For instance, have you talked to your school guidance counselor about the problem? They might be able to refer you to some resources that could help. Also, while I don't know the exact details of your parents’ legal situation, in many cases, there will be a court-appointed child advocate to speak up for children in situations like yours. If you have one already, then please go to them and talk to them about how best to handle this difficult situation. If you don’t have one, then ask one of your parents' attorneys or an official at the court during the next legal hearing if you can be provided with one. These professionals are trained to represent children's interests in cases like yours.

From your letter, it's evident that you have a lot of courage and you're trying to do what's right. In closing, I want to make it very clear that none of this is your fault. The problem is between your parents, not with you. And none of the pain that you're going through should be interpreted as a result of something you did wrong. You are just caught in a very hard situation, and you seem to be doing your best to manage it. Best of luck to you.

QUESTION: I'm male, 40 years old, work in tech. For a few years now, I've been attending a professional meetup of other tech enthusiasts and professionals. We meet a few times a month and engage in activities such as discussing technical books, delivering presentations, but mostly just hanging out and coding. My first year in the group, I met another guy, let's call him John. John and I seemed to be fast friends. We were both interested in the same types of technology and seemed to have compatible personalities. I was a bit further along in tech than he was, so I sort of took on a mentorship role. But over time, he's learned a lot too. More importantly, we've hung out a lot outside of tech, doing things like movie nights, going bowling together, and meeting up for coffee. We even write each other Christmas cards. 

The problem is that over time, this friendship has gotten to be one-sided. Over the last year or two, I'm virtually always the only one to initiate. I'm always the one to suggest going out for coffee or going to see a movie or having lunch. And this is also the case in deeper aspects of the friendship. For instance, he has a disabled adult nephew. I often come over and perform basic tasks, such as helping to prepare meals or simply just talking to the nephew, which considerably eases the burden on the rest of the family. This isn't to toot my own horn, but just to establish context. But when it comes to reciprocity, John's nowhere to be found. My wife is on disability, and I have a niece who's been struggling with a nasty eating disorder and has had to live at home instead of leaving town for college. When I ask John to do simple things, such as drive me to my niece's medical appointment when my car is in the shop, or to just simply come over and help with my family the same way I help with his, he's nowhere to be found. He's always making excuses such as “I'm too tired” or “I have to work tomorrow.” Oh and also when I ran a marathon last year, he was nowhere to be found - either in encouraging me before the race when I was going through grueling training or in going to see the actual event. But when his local hockey league plays games, I'm almost always there. I realize that everybody has an outside life, but after years of this, you start to wonder. 

It's gotten to a point where this is one-sided and exhausting. None of my other friends are like this. I feel guilty complaining about this and I don't want to hurt John's feelings. That's why I haven't brought this up before. But this isn't sustainable. What should I do? 

ANSWER: A friendship where one person does all the giving becomes unsustainable over time. When such arrangements persist for years, people often feel taken advantage of and even like they're being used. You understandably want reciprocity, but he seems to not be delivering. Lack of reciprocity can destroy a friendship like death by a thousand cuts. It can also cause lasting feelings of distrust that might spill over into other relationships in a person's life. And in your case, you don't want to hurt your friend's feelings, but you also have come to feel that the situation is untenable. 

The reality, though, is that sometimes you have to risk hurting someone's feelings to stand up for yourself. While every person and every relationship is different, most people do agree that there needs to be a degree of reciprocity in a friendship, especially with respect to the big things, such as family caregiving or supporting the other person in a big life event. If a friendship stops being a two-way street, then it risks becoming a burden or even a dependency. And this is something that most people don't want.

I recommend having a conversation with John where you respectfully but firmly lay out the problem and your boundaries. You could say something like, "Hey John, I really like having you as a friend and hanging out with you, but I've noticed that I initiate almost all of our hangouts and that you haven't come to important things of mine, such as helping out with family or coming to my marathon, whereas I have tried to do those things for you as much as I can. How can we fix this?"

If he responds amicably, then it's just a matter of nudging the balance in a more equitable direction, probably over time. The challenge in this case will be to try to make things more equitable without falling into the trap of “bean counting.” And if this happy outcome does come to pass, then you can ignore the rest of this letter. But if his response is unfriendly, such as being defensive or stonewalling, or even just apathetic (which can be just as hostile in its own way) then you might want to reconsider how you've been investing your time. In this case, you might have to decide whether his companionship is worth the emotional and logistical stress of him relying on you for important things, but not being able to do the same yourself. Retaining a friendship with someone you care about isn't worth it if the friendship is drastically one-sided and you're carrying all of the burden. Sometimes doing the hard thing and ending a friendship and hurting the other person's feelings is necessary to shift your time investment to people who have your back as well.

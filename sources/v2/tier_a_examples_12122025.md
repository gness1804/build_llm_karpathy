QUESTION: My husband and I have been married for 10 years, and while it's mostly been a good marriage with the usual ups and downs, a toxic dynamic has evolved where both of us rush to blame the other during arguments. For example, last week our cat escaped and my youngest child and I spent several hours looking for her before a neighbor thankfully found and returned her. The relief of having her back should have been the end of it, but instead the incident sparked a painful argument about whose "fault" it was—-my husband blamed me for leaving the door open when I went out to tend to our plants (I was only outside for a few minutes), while I blamed him because the only reason I went out to water the plants was that he had neglected to do it after saying he would take care of them. The argument was unproductive, as almost all of our arguments are. We've been in couples therapy but haven't made much progress, in part because my husband doesn't take therapy seriously. How can we overcome this blame dynamic and develop a better marital relationship?

ANSWER: This is a common problem, so you're hardly alone in facing this. Your husband's reluctance to take therapy seriously is discouraging, but there are other approaches you can take. During a moment when both of you are calm, approach him and say something like, "Honey, I've noticed that when we fight, we often blame each other for problems, and this doesn't resolve anything. It just results in hurt feelings for both of us. What do you think we can do to address this?"

Much will depend on how he responds. If he doesn't respond well, particularly after repeated attempts to address this amicably, then it might behoove you to engage in solo therapy to explore any underlying problems behind this pattern. But if he is open to engaging with you, try this exercise: the next time you have an argument and one of you starts blaming the other, get out a piece of paper and each of you write down possible solutions, with a rule that nobody can write anything blaming the other partner—just focus on solutions. Blame is a dynamic that tends to be self-reinforcing: the more you resort to blame, the more it feels natural, but the good news is that it works the other way as well—the less you engage in blame over time, the less it becomes the default way of "solving" problems. Over time, this exercise should help change this difficult dynamic while also solving the original problems more quickly. I would also recommend reading John Gottman's book, "The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work," which contains excellent advice about the blame game and other marital challenges.

QUESTION: My husband and I are facing a dilemma over how to respond to a problem with how his family treats his brother. Both of us have long suspected that my husband's brother is gay. At one point, the brother even came to my husband asking for advice on how to come out of the closet. However, in large part because of their family's attitudes, the brother has never actually come out to them. From time to time, I overhear some of my husband's family, particularly my father-in-law, make offensive and cruel remarks about gay people. I don't know if the father-in-law suspects that one of his sons is gay or not, but regardless, this creates an alienating environment for us and obviously especially for the brother.

Our dilemma is on how to respond to this, if at all. I would like for us, or at least for my husband, to bring this up with his father and to make clear that we don't approve of these cruel remarks. My husband has made it clear that even though he strongly disapproves of the anti-gay remarks, he wants to preserve his relationship with his father and doesn't want to intervene. I tend to feel that since it's his family, he should have more of a say on how to engage with them. But it really hurts to stand by and say nothing while my husband's father creates such an intolerant environment. Do you think that we should just let this go or do you feel that it's worth risking our relationship with his father to try to improve the situation?

ANSWER: What about the brother's opinion of all this? Before confronting his father, why don't you two, or just your husband, approach the brother and gently ask him what he thinks the best course of action is? Given that he seems to be the one most affected by the remarks, his opinion should be given special weight. Only confront the father if the brother is okay with that. You don't want to risk a backlash by confronting the father and then him responding by treating his son even worse. And even though what the father is saying is clearly abhorrent, the son that you suspect is gay might have his own reasons for wanting to preserve his own relationship with his father.

Regardless of whether you choose to confront the father directly, there are more subtle ways that you can send signals of disapproval about the remarks. For instance, you can limit your visits to those particular relatives when the father is around. You can also invite the brother to spend more time with you and your husband separately, apart from his parents. And the next time you happen to overhear a remark, you might consider going the route of asking a question as opposed to direct confrontation. That is, maybe you could ask the father, "If you were gay, how would you feel about other people saying that about you?" I've often found that when dealing with difficult people, asking them respectful but direct critical questions is often a more effective strategy than simply laying down the law and telling them that they're wrong. Although I admit, I'm human too, and often the temptation for the latter is quite strong in that type of situation. But regardless of what approach you take, remember that empathy and compassion should be your guiding lights. Make sure that the brother's needs are first and foremost in whatever solution you decide on.

QUESTION: My wife and I are expecting our first child, a daughter. As you might imagine, we're over the moon about being new parents and nurturing and loving this new human. Nevertheless, my wife and I are engaged in a nasty recurring argument over whether to baptize our future daughter. My wife came from a fairly secular family but experienced trauma in her early adulthood, including a sexual assault. She found an on-campus religious community that provided tremendous support to her in her healing. And after college she has continued to attend church in that same denomination. She's been a part of this denomination for about 15 years at this point, and I have nothing against her doing this. Obviously she's an autonomous adult, and we don't have to agree on religion. But in my case, I'm an atheist who had some very bad experiences with religion growing up, including multiple attempts to proselytize me. I also had a friend who was abused by a priest. And so for me, organized religion is the root of much evil with corporate greed being the root of most of the rest.

My wife wants to baptize our daughter in her denomination because she wants to pass on to her child the deep connection that she has to her faith. And also, I suspect, because she feels that on some level being part of this religious community might shield her daughter from the trauma that she went through as a younger woman. But for me, I worry that baptizing our daughter in this religion would essentially brainwash and indoctrinate her. I fear our daughter wanting to marry young and then becoming obedient to her husband due to our church's teachings. The denomination is one of the more conservative ones, and I don't agree with most of their teachings. I want our daughter to be a strong young woman, not a slave to her future husband because of religious brainwashing. Should I just give in and let her get indoctrinated, or should I fight harder for her to not be baptized?

ANSWER: It seems like you're falling into a trap that many religious and secular people both fall into: framing a problem as a strict black-and-white either/or matter. Fundamentally, it seems to me that both you and your wife are coming from a place of love, and your differences are rooted in very different life experiences with religion. I don't know how much you've talked to your wife about this, but if you haven't, I would suggest first having an open and frank discussion with her about religion in general and what it means to each of you. Frame this in a way that respects her beliefs and life experiences while also reminding her that yours are just as valid, and agree to temporarily stay away from the subject of your daughter's potential baptism. This might help you two to get on the same page on religion in general, and not just over the question of baptizing your daughter. 

Then, when you two have found some common ground over religion (even if it is very limited), return to the subject of the baptism. There might be multiple ways to skin this cat that respect both of your viewpoints and beliefs. For instance, might you agree to having the daughter baptized in a more liberal denomination? This might satisfy your wife's wishes for her to be baptized as a Christian without being baptized in the same denomination whose beliefs you find so problematic. This might seem like an unacceptable compromise, but it's worked for a lot of couples. For instance, when I was dating my wife, I was very reluctant to convert to the dominant religion of her family because I found it unpalatable in many ways. But we compromised, and I converted into a more liberal denomination of the faith, which ended up working out fairly well for us. And don't forget to keep in mind the bigger picture of what your daughter herself might eventually want. Hopefully you and your wife would both agree that when your daughter is old enough to do so, she should be the one to determine her future path, be it a religious path or a secular one. So I think it makes sense to expose her to a mixture of religious and secular viewpoints. The exact contours of this will, of course, be up to you and your wife and eventually up to her. But by coming from a place of compassion and love, you will put her in a position to be well-equipped to make her own faith decision when the time comes.

QUESTION: Like so many others, my teenage daughter is struggling with an eating disorder. In her case, she's lost so many pounds in the last few weeks that she barely resembles her old self. She's obsessed with the idea that she's fat, but in reality, she's dangerously underweight. Making matters worse, my husband seems to not take her situation seriously enough. While I fear for her life if she doesn't get treatment soon, my husband often brushes off the subject when I talk to him about it. He says things like, "Oh, she's just going through a phase," or "Maybe she just doesn't like the food that you cook." I think that my daughter is overhearing this and it might be encouraging her to starve herself even more.

I've always been the non-confrontational type, which I fear has contributed to my daughter getting into the mess that she's in. So I'm not sure really how to confront my husband about this. What do you suggest?

ANSWER: As you noted, this is a life-or-death situation. What I would do is urgently get both your daughter and husband educated on the serious problem of eating disorders, "tout de suite." First, if you haven't already, inform your daughter of the following resources: the 24/7 eating disorder hotline (866-932-1264) and the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD) Helpline (888-375-7767). I would also insist that both your daughter and your husband visit the website of the National Eating Disorders Association, particularly their helpful article "Busting The Myths About Eating Disorders" (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/busting-myths-about-eating-disorders/). 

The immediate problem, of course, is helping your daughter to get healthy and overcome the disorder, and to learn the skills needed to prevent relapses in the future. This starts with a conversation with her primary care physician and also her therapist, if she has one. But I suspect you're doing most of this already. What you wrote to me about was really a problem of attitudes and education on the part of your husband. In addition to showing him the above-mentioned resources, I would have a serious conversation with him about how his attitudes might be harming his daughter. There is also some underlying sexism and misogyny in his remarks, particularly about what he said about the food that you cook. But educating him on eating disorders is the first priority. Then you can have a longer discussion with him (ideally also with a couples therapist) addressing some of these problematic assumptions that he seems to have about you and about gender roles.

Finally, by all means, whenever your husband makes one of these remarks and there's even the possibility that your daughter could have been around, seek her out at your first opportunity and emphasize to her that what her father said was wrong. Tell her the facts in a calm manner, not to demonize her father but rather to show that his harmful views aren't correct. Facts and sincere affirmation are the best antidotes to misguided and harmful ignorance.

QUESTION: I feel that I'm a walking, breathing cliche. I'm a 54-year-old woman whose similarly-aged husband cheated on me with his 24-year-old secretary. It's really the oldest story on God's green earth. I naively took him at his word when he told me that he was working late on Monday and Wednesday evenings. He told me that he had a big project to finish up, and his boss had laid off his assistant, so he was forced to do two people's jobs. Thus, he had to spend many hours at work outside of the workday to get it all done. 

Imagine my surprise when my best friend told me that she had seen my husband and a much younger woman out at a nice restaurant after working hours while my friend was on a date there! I confronted him, and after initial predictable denials, he confessed. He told me that she made him feel young and wanted. Again, you can find countless examples of this story down to the small details. But now that I'm reeling from this betrayal, I'm wondering whether to stay or to leave him. He has always been a good husband and provider, and I believe him when he told me that he hasn't slept with anybody outside of the marriage except for the secretary. He swore to me that he would change. However, a couple of weeks ago, after we tried to reconcile, my friend once again saw him out with the girlfriend at the same restaurant. (He could have at least been smart about it and gone to a different restaurant with her.) Clearly he hasn't ended things with her. He has many good qualities, but I don't know if I can forgive him for this. Should I stay or should I go?

ANSWER: I'm sorry that you're in this situation. Nobody deserves to be cheated on. Whether to stay or go in the event of an extramarital affair is one of those questions where good, reasonable people can disagree. Some are of the opinion that even one incident of cheating is too much, and that the trust can never be restored. On the other hand, others subscribe to the school of thought of allowing their partners a second or even third chance. Clearly you're at least open to the possibility of taking him back, but given that this betrayal has happened multiple times and that the deceit is continuing after his assurances that it wouldn't, I would be hesitant about taking him back.

If you haven't already, find a good therapist to discuss this question with. Try to look for larger patterns. For instance, have you been cheated on before and then taken a partner back? What happened then? Your husband told you that he hasn't cheated on you with anyone except for the secretary, but has he engaged in any other dishonest behavior, such as using family money for questionable purposes? Usually when somebody is deceitful or dishonest in one area, they act similarly in other areas. Ultimately, the decision on whether to stay or go is yours, but I would exercise caution regarding his ability to change given what you've experienced thus far. If there were a graveyard for all failed relationships and marriages, probably about half of the headstones would read: "She tried to change him."

QUESTION: My husband has a habit of criticizing me when I do something wrong, or when he thinks I do something wrong. This behavior has unfortunately been escalating over the past few months. It started even before our wedding. For instance, he would remark upon my having chosen the "wrong" dress rather than telling a white lie that he liked the dress. Also, he would say things like, "You must be so glad you found me given how you were living before." Like most people in love, I brushed off these red flags, thinking that he would change after the wedding. But alas, things only got worse from there. Now that we've been married several years and have two kids, he started insulting me in front of the kids. He also tries to make me believe things that I know aren't true. For instance, by repeating lies to me, such as accusing me of losing our house keys, when in fact he's the one who misplaced them. They were found in the pocket of his suit jacket, for goodness sake!

My husband is mostly a wonderful man and a good father, and I dread the prospect of becoming a single mother, so I don't want to lose him. I've tried talking with him about the insults, but he always brushes me off. Is there a way that I can address this to salvage the marriage? Or do you think I should look for the exit?

ANSWER: Oh my goodness, you should run and not walk to the exit door. This is a textbook case of emotional and verbal abuse and gaslighting. Your husband insults you even after you've pointed it out and asked him to stop. He tries to get you to believe things that you know aren't true, and thus to undermine your confidence in yourself and your sense of reality, which is the definition of gaslighting. And he's doing it in front of your children. You even say that these are "red flags." This marriage is clearly beyond the point of no return. Rather than trying to change him, you should look for the safest and quickest way out of the marriage, which I know won't be easy.

The good news is that there are resources for domestic violence victims like you to get out safely. The first steps should be to find a time when he's not around and call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. This service is available in many languages to everyone who needs it. They will help you devise an escape plan. Also, what support network do you have? Do you have a mother or sister or brother or best friend who could help you? Speak to someone who you trust about the situation. Hopefully, they will see the obvious fact that this is domestic abuse and they will rush to help. If not, don't let them convince you that what you're seeing isn't true. Go to somebody else you trust. If you don't have anyone around you who you trust, then find a local women's shelter. They can provide you with a lot of resources. And when the time comes, of course, you'll need to visit an attorney. But your safety comes before everything else. You deserve so much better, and you need to get out now. Good luck to you.

QUESTION: I'm a 37-year-old man, and I live with my long-term partner. No kids. My brother and I are not close. He lives just a 3-hour drive away, and we routinely make drives longer than that for various reasons, but we only see him maybe once every couple of years. And this includes Christmases and Thanksgivings. We are not actively hostile. We get along relatively well, and we have a few things in common. But we really are at the level of at most casual friends. I have co-workers who I'm closer to than my brother. I want to reconcile with him, but I really don't know how. You have any strategies for trying to connect with a semi-estranged but not hostile sibling?

ANSWER: It's hard to know exactly what advice to provide, given the limited context I have here. What are the reasons for the estrangement? Is it a sibling rivalry? A falling out? Or something else? Or was it more just a matter of personalities that clashed?

The general advice on family estrangement is that it's heavily context-specific. In the most extreme cases, such as abuse, the right and reasonable course of action is to cut off contact to the extent possible. But it doesn't sound from your letter like this is the case. In less extreme situations, it really depends a lot on the reasons for the estrangement and knowing the other person, how you think they would react. In these less extreme situations, it's usually a good idea to reach out directly to the person and try to clear the air. This doesn't necessarily need to involve a tell-all or a play-by-play recounting of what happened in the past between you. It could just be something along the lines of: "Hey [Brother], I'm sure you've noticed we don't talk very often and I'd like to change that. I value you as a sibling and love you and hope that we can have a good relationship. What do you think about that?" 

That conveys that you've taken the initiative to try to improve the situation, and that then puts the ball in his court. Ultimately, it will depend on how he responds as to whether or not you two can have a closer relationship. You will have done your part by starting the conversation just mentioned. Another thing I would suggest is to try to meet him at his place rather than the reverse. You can make that 3-hour drive as an additional gesture of your goodwill. Obviously with some advance notice, however. Good luck.

QUESTION: My daughter just came out to my husband and me. It happened relatively undramatically. We were all sitting around the kitchen table, eating dinner, and she mentioned that she had something to tell us. She said that her friend, who we will call Chloe, is actually her girlfriend, and that she's been pretty sure that she is gay for some time. She's 16. She says that while she's been attracted to other girls aside from Chloe, Chloe is the first one to actually reciprocate. And she says she's never been attracted to any boys.

My husband and I paused for a moment, not out of disapproval, but because we simply didn't know how to respond. Finally, we both said something about how we love her and that she's glad and that we're glad that she has enough trust in us to confide in us about this. Neither my husband nor I are homophobic. We have both long supported gay rights, and we've both been close to people who are gay. My husband even bought a small pride flag for her room. The problem though is how do we go about actually relating to her? While my husband and I are honestly elated that we won't have to deal with any teen pregnancy scares, we're also unsure about how we as straight people can truly relate to her experiences. We know that, when it comes to dating and relationships, gay and straight people have many things in common, more so than what divides them. But being gay in our still substantially homophobic society is an experience that neither my husband and I have ever known firsthand. Do you have any suggestions or resources on how to connect with her on this?

ANSWER: About three-quarters of the battle has already been won. She is very lucky to have such loving and supportive parents. Sadly, many people in her situation don't. When it comes to the question of how to relate to her better, you can start the conversation with what you mentioned to me: that there are many similarities between what people experience in gay relationships and what they experience in straight ones. The giddiness and euphoria of a first love, the experience of heartbreak, rejection, hope, physical and emotional intimacy--these experiences are universal and don't conform to lines of sexual labels. You can probably relate a great deal to what she's going through if you had a relationship or a crush at her age.

And as far as the experiences that don't overlap between straight and gay people, compassion and proactivity is the name of the game. Reinform your unconditional love and support for her and for her choice of partner, whoever that may be. Be proactive without being overbearing. Initiate some of these conversations and discussions, while also knowing when to hang back. And above all, just be there for her. Gay or straight, teenagers need to have that affirmation from parents. With parents also granting them more autonomy, assuming that their behavior and maturity justify it. And yes, by all means, celebrate that when she goes out with her girlfriend, there's not the risk of a pregnancy involved. And remember that even though she still needs guardrails, as all under-18s do, she's also on the cusp of adulthood and is experiencing a situation that's novel for her. Be there with love, compassion, and common sense, offering advice when needed, but generally leaving her to have her own experiences and make her own mistakes. This is the best way to equip her to navigate not only her current relationship but all the ones that follow.

QUESTION: I'm 28 years old (female), and my boyfriend is 33. We get along well and he's a great guy, loves me, loves my dog, wants kids, is usually pretty low maintenance. The problem is, well, I suppose a common one. It's a new time and in many cases, women are working and earning more than men. We are a textbook example of this. Although in our case, I am the only one earning anything at all! I just finished grad school last year and I have a really good, promising job in the finance industry. Nothing like those Wolf of Wall Street financiers but still a good, sustainable job. My boyfriend, by contrast, has always been a bit of a dreamer. He dropped out of college once, then finished a couple years later after volunteering in several cities in America and earning very little money. I met him during his second college stint when I was finishing up college myself. We had a period of long distance but long story short, decided it was worth it, stuck out the long distance, and then started living together after he was able to move back to our town. He also got a master's degree somewhere along the way but isn't using it. He says he wants to change the world and has big plans to end world hunger and to improve global education.

Part of the reason why I fell in love with him was that idealism. But honestly, the situation is starting to become untenable. As I mentioned, he doesn't work right now. He's in a volunteer gig and he sometimes picks up shifts as an Uber driver. But that's hardly what he went to grad school to do. When I urge him to help pay at least a respectable portion of the rent, he keeps talking to me about how his dreams are so important and how so many people in third-world countries are living so much worse than us. So you shouldn't be complaining. I get and understand that there are lots of people who have it worse off than us. But that's still no excuse in my view for what he's doing. As I alluded to earlier, I'm interested in starting a family soon, but can't imagine doing it with him until he does a 180 with his life. And when I have mentioned kids around him, he seems at best ambivalent. What should I do? Stay or go?

ANSWER: I think you've probably answered your own question. You tell me that you've talked to him about the problem, but he blows you off talking about his big dreams. And it seems like he's been like this for some time based on your letter. So, honestly, your lifestyles and what you want in the future just aren't compatible. You have a promising career. He seems to just want to follow his dreams by not working. And you've said that he "seems at best ambivalent" about having children, which you say is one of your big goals. And at 28, you're probably aware that you won't have forever to make this happen. 

You've invested a number of years in this man, and I have no doubt that there's lots of love between you. Any breakup would be devastating, but would breaking up with him be any more devastating than foregoing your wish to have children in order to accommodate someone who has had years to start to build a gainful career but apparently hasn't done so? And even with your well-paying job, I imagine that the stress of having to support him, as well as yourself, is starting to get to you. My younger sister had a boyfriend much like him. Sweet guy, really loved her, great with her dog. But he just wouldn't get his life together. He was working a dead-end theater job and he made no efforts to try to better his situation, either by going back to school or by looking for another job. My sister made the heartbreaking but necessary decision to end it with him. It looks like you are in a quite similar situation. So unless there is something big that you haven't told me about in this letter that would change this situation (such as a large inheritance from his rich uncle), I would urge you to likewise end this relationship and look for someone who is going to pull his weight in the relationship, and eventually as a father, whether or not this conforms with glamorous ideas of dreams. I know it's always very hurtful to end a relationship, but I think that you, as my sister did, will look back on this breakup and realize that although it hurt, you did the right thing for both of you.

QUESTION: I'm 27 and my boyfriend is 30; we've been together for three years and living together for 1.5 years. We get along well and are managing financially, but the problem is with his parents. They're in their late 60s, living on limited income (his father is retired from the military, his mother was a teacher until she quit due to osteoarthritis), but despite their modest pensions, they've made extremely inadvisable financial decisions—luxury cruises, expensive restaurants they can't afford. They're emotionally manipulative, constantly playing on the fact that he's their only child to get him to spend money on them and go into debt. He can't seem to resist, and I think part of it is his sense of duty carried over from when he was in the military—he feels he owes his parents for raising him and wants to give back. They're taking advantage of this. I've tried talking to him about this multiple times, but he always says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else. I love him and don't want to leave, but I also don't want us to go broke because he can't say no to his parents. Is there any hope left for us?

ANSWER: "He always just says that his duty to his parents supersedes everything else." I think this tells you all that you need to know. I don't doubt that he loves you and that his sense of duty also includes a commitment to you. He sounds like a noble person, but people with a strong sense of duty can be vulnerable to manipulation, as you've seen. In this predicament with his parents, you've asked him multiple times to reconsider his supporting and enabling them, but he isn't responsive to that. And he doesn't seem to respect your input or try to seek any sort of compromise with respect to the money that he spends and the debt that he goes into for them.

This shouldn't remain your problem. You've done your best and made your feelings known to him, but he's ignored them repeatedly. Sadly, I think the best choice that you have is to end the relationship and start over. You don't want to become a second enabler for his parents. Nor do you want his consistent choosing of his parents over you to wreck your own credit and damage your own financial future.

QUESTION: My best friend recently got back together with her ex-boyfriend, who I know was emotionally abusive to her. She cut off her other best friend for telling her to leave him, and now she's threatening to cut me off too over a trivial political disagreement we had. I'm trying to be a safe presence for her like people advised, but it's getting harder as she keeps ghosting me or being cold and distant. How do I handle this without losing my friend completely, and how do I stop feeling terrible about it?

ANSWER: You can't fix this for her, and you shouldn't try to. Your friend is in a cycle of abuse where she's isolating herself from people who care about her—this is unfortunately common in abusive relationships. The person who's supposed to be her safe place (you) is being pushed away, while the person causing harm is being drawn closer. Your role right now isn't to be a regular friend who gets regular friendship back. It's to be a lifeline that stays available even when she's not using it.

That means: keep reaching out periodically with low-pressure check-ins. Don't expect her to respond, and don't take her distance personally. When she does respond, don't lecture her about the boyfriend—just be present. Say things like, "I'm here whenever you need me, no questions asked." The goal is to make sure she knows you're still there when she's ready to leave. As for feeling terrible about it—that's actually appropriate. It is terrible to watch someone you care about self-destruct. But remember: her choices aren't your fault, and you can't rescue her if she doesn't want to be rescued. You can only keep the door open. In the meantime, make sure you're taking care of yourself. This is emotionally draining work, and you deserve support too. Consider talking to a therapist or joining a support group for friends and family of people in abusive relationships.

QUESTION: I'm on the autism spectrum and my partner is also neurodivergent, albeit in a different way. This has been a source of connection, but also a source of struggle. For example, they frequently express frustration when I'm not reading their social cues in the way that they expect me to. They also get irritated if I leave the room because they're cooking a certain thing, or if I'm focusing on obsessive interest, as we autists are known for. I do try to communicate my needs to them, and they seem receptive to it. But often it seems like we're getting nowhere. Our brains are wired too differently. Any recommendations on how to bridge the gap?

ANSWER: This is a common problem in neurologically mixed relationships. Even with both partners being neurodivergent, being neurodivergent in different ways is often just as challenging as one partner being neurodivergent and the other neurotypical. But you're not alone in this struggle. If you aren't doing it already, I would highly recommend couples counseling. This should help you begin to work through some of these issues. There are many compromises that you can make that would be worthwhile. For instance, your partner agrees not to cook certain food with you around, or you agree to set aside a certain amount of time for them each day so that you don't get sucked into your strong interest as much. The keys are compassion, empathy, and a willingness to listen.

There's also a growing body of resources available for couples in your situation. In particular, I would recommend that you both read the book "The Autism Partner Handbook: How to Love an Autistic Person" by Elly Blue, Faith G. Harper, and Joe Biel. It's a quick read and offers a lot of useful suggestions for your situation. Navigating neurodivergence is a challenge, but plenty of other couples have done it. Good luck.

QUESTION: I'm the mother of two kids, a son age 15 and a daughter age 13. My son has expressed a strong interest in being a physician, a goal that I support because he has a genuine love for medicine—he's been interested in it from a very young age and has loved his hospital shadowing experiences. The problem is that he's so focused on school and grades that he isn't doing any extracurriculars. I worry that now that he's in high school, not having extracurriculars will hurt his chances of getting into a good college and eventually medical school, even if he maintains his excellent grades. I don't like the "extracurricular arms race" that high school has become, but I recognize we have to work within the system as it exists. I've repeatedly encouraged him to find an extracurricular he likes, even suggesting the Science Club since science is his favorite subject, but he always says he's focused on schoolwork and that Science Club would be redundant since he already studies science outside of school. I want him to forge his own path, but I also don't want him to make choices that could hurt his chances of getting into medical school or another professional or graduate school. How can I strike a balance between providing sound parental advice and giving him the autonomy he needs to make his own choices?

ANSWER: I agree with you about the extracurricular arms race—it's unfortunate that these activities have become boxes to check rather than enriching experiences, but you're right that we need to work within the system. A good first step is to talk to his guidance counselor (and encourage him to do the same) to understand what extracurricular portfolios look like for recent graduates who got into good colleges; you can also talk to other parents and look at reputable websites (avoid sources like U.S. News and World Report, which exaggerate prestige factors). Being armed with facts helps reduce over-worrying. I would stress that having one or two extracurriculars can be important for college admissions—it's not fair, but that's how the system works. My brother had virtually perfect grades and a 1600 SAT score yet didn't get into Yale, and we think his lack of extracurriculars was a major factor. Does your son have friends in extracurriculars who've had good experiences? Does he have interests outside of science that could be pursued in an extracurricular? Most schools offer many options, and even if his doesn't, there should be something that appeals to his interests. Remind him that these organizations are good ways to make friends and can be enriching beyond just a line on a resume. Good luck—he sounds like a really good kid.

QUESTION: My wife comes from a large, close-knit family, while I come from a much smaller family. Sometimes it seems like I have lived "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." But movie references aside, this has resulted in cultural adaptations for both of us. Geography also shapes our interactions with our respective families, especially around the holidays. Her family is mostly local. The majority of them live within an hour driving radius. By contrast, my family is very spread out. By "spread out", I mean that I need to get on a plane to see three of my four immediate family members. And there's no destination I can go to where I will be within 200 miles of more than one of my immediate family members. As you can imagine, this means that we spend most holidays with her family. It just makes logistical sense, especially because traveling over the holidays is such a nightmare. But at the same time, I feel that this is a bit inequitable. I grew up assuming that my wife and I would alternate families to visit for the holidays, as a lot of people do. For instance, we see her family for Thanksgiving, I see hers for Christmas, then do it the reverse the following year. But the distance makes this impractical. I also have limited time off from work, and we like to travel outside of the holidays for leisure purposes as well. How can we pay heed to logistical realities while also making things more equitable?

ANSWER: Short of a couple or more of your family members moving, there isn't really a way to do it without working around the geography. There are a great many families that can't simply do the one-side-for-Thanksgiving/other-for-Christmas pattern that you mentioned. For instance, some relatives have limited mobility. Some relatives have much larger houses to support family gatherings than others. And as in your situation, geography is often a major factor. So I'd say the first step for you would be to step back from the script that you've been trying to follow and recognize the diversity of experiences out there. There's no one-size-fits-all model for the holidays.

Now come the actual logistical suggestions. You may not see your family as often as you see hers, but there are still some ways to work out compromises. For instance, maybe travel every other year to see a long-distance relative around Christmas, since Christmas tends to be a little bit better than Thanksgiving for travel. You can cut down on outside-of-holidays travel on the years that you go to see your relatives. Or you can invent your own traditions. For example, you could have an early Christmas at one of your relatives' houses and hope that other family members fly in as well. This avoids the worst holiday travel and also gives you yet another celebration to look forward to. You could do the same for Thanksgiving. I have experienced both of these things, and the celebration feels just as festive as if it were on the official calendar day. These situations are always challenging, but they are definitely workable. It's also important to keep perspective: compared to financial issues, disparate philosophies on child-rearing, and many other hard problems, this is a breeze. So go enjoy your Festivus or your Pre-Christmas. I'm sure that they will be just as wonderful and memorable as the traditional holidays.

QUESTION: I've been in a serious relationship for a few years now. Things have been going really well between us. I mean, we have our issues like every couple, but overall, things are great. I love him, he loves me, we both love each other's families. The problem is that he's expressed interest in opening up the relationship. I'm not enthused about the idea. Although I don't consider myself particularly religious or traditional, I do think that intimate relationships should be one-on-one. No judgment towards anybody else, but that's how I want my own life to be. He says that he wants to explore other people outside the relationship but remain committed to me. He cited several examples of our friends who have done it and he emphasizes that I would always remain his primary partner. He also said that I can meet any and all of his other partners and that he would be above board about everything. I have no reason to think that he's seeing anyone behind my back. He's always been an honest person. But I don't really feel comfortable with an open relationship. I've expressed this, but he keeps bringing it up. Is there hope for us?

ANSWER: Polyamorous relationships are becoming more and more common these days. I think you have the right approach by being non-judgmental, but also by knowing what you want personally. Since he has mentioned it multiple times even though you've expressed not wanting to pursue this, this seems like a fundamental incompatibility issue. How exactly does he respond when you tell him that you're not interested? Is it dismissive, or does it seem sincere? Polyamory is something that both relationship partners have to sign off on. And in fact, not just sign off on, but be committed to. In spite of common misconceptions, polyamory takes just as much commitment as a traditional monogamous relationship, and in some ways even more, since it's incumbent upon each partner to inform their original partner of everyone else they're sleeping with, plus get STD tests and do other due diligence. And there are always concerns about developing an emotional connection with a secondary partner that outweighs that with a primary partner.

The fundamental question is whether you want a polyamorous relationship or you want to keep your current partner. It appears that you can't have both. I would have one more conversation with him in which you are crystal clear that you love him and you want to stay with him, but polyamory just isn't for you. Tell him that if he really wants a polyamorous relationship, that it won't work out between you two. Ask him point-blank if he wants to go ahead with polyamory or if he wants to remain with you. Emphasize that he can't have both--in a loving way, of course, not in a way that sounds like an ultimatum. I know that even broaching the subject of a breakup can be very painful in a relationship as committed as yours seems to be. But better to determine that now rather than later. Good luck.

QUESTION: My brother and I have always been very competitive. We were raised in a household where academic success was valued above almost everything else. He and I were both very good students, but he was the better one. In particular, I struggled at math. But he always aced his math classes and now has a math PhD as well as one in physics. I have, "only," a single PhD in a non-math related field. Our competition dynamic led to a distant relationship that we have had during our entire adult lives. We're both in our early forties. I want to try to mend the rift, but I'm not sure where to begin. This is complicated by the fact that on the relatively rare occasions that we see each other, the old competitive dynamic emerges again. For instance, recently when we were visiting our mother, we played games such as Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble in which he smoked me. He's never been a jerk or bragged about beating me in things, but I still feel the effects of it. How can we move towards a more productive dynamic?

ANSWER: Sibling rivalries are always hard, and while your relationship is generally cordial, the competitive dynamic from your past complicates it. I admire your willingness to reach out. Start by having an initial conversation with him to break the ice and build a better relationship—in this first conversation, don't mention the competitive dynamic unless it comes up. Just focus on the fact that you've been distant and that you want to be more a part of his life. He should be receptive to that unless he has some sort of secret grudge against you.

Regardless of how he responds, it's important for you to do some work on yourself to question this mentality of competition, ideally with a therapist. Try to understand not just where this idea of competition comes from, but how it affects you now: does it add to your life or take away from it? I would also urge you to cultivate hobbies and interests that don't depend on competition, such as gardening, art, or single-player video games. And stay away from social media, which amplifies the "keeping up with the Joneses" dynamic. With some healthy new hobbies and ways of thinking, you'll be well on your way to better managing this relationship and, equally importantly, your own mental health.

QUESTION: I've become very attracted to someone at my school. I'm in my mid-30s, and I am in an intensive vocational school that's co-educational. My cohort ranges in age from early 20s to 50s, although most of us are in the late 20s/early 30s range. I am a guy, and there's a girl in our cohort who is a few years younger than me. She and I are both introverts, and we bonded over this. She has also said that she sees me as handsome, though I need to remind myself that this doesn't necessarily indicate romantic interest. But I feel that our connection is becoming stronger with each conversation. We don't spend a lot of one-on-one time, but we always seem to end up talking to each other in group settings.

Unfortunately, she's engaged. I really want to be respectful of her relationship and not be a homewrecker, but at the same time I feel what I feel. Is there a way forward for us? Should I venture to satisfy my curiosity regarding whether she shares my feelings, or should I keep quiet about this?

ANSWER: While acknowledging the emotional complexities of the situation, I think you've answered your own questions. You want to respect her relationship, you don't want to be a homewrecker, and she's engaged. So that means that no, there's not a way forward for you two romantically, unless she breaks up with her fiancé. And needless to say, if this happens, it can't be because you contributed to it.

People have unrequited romantic feelings all the time, and also requited ones that can't be acted upon in situations such as yours. It's possible she shares your feelings, but it's equally possible she doesn't. And the larger point is that this is a question that needs to remain unanswered. Because, let's say she does share the feelings. Well, then what? There's no way for you two to act on them without breaking ethical rules that we can all agree on. So knowing that she shares these feelings, if she indeed does, would cause you even more torment. 

Continue to engage her as a friend within appropriate boundaries. But as far as romance, approach her with the mentality that romance is off the table and always will be.

QUESTION: I work from home, as do many people. As many people have experienced in the work-from-home era, this can be at once liberating and lonely. None of my coworkers are even located in the city where I live, so I can't even meet up with them occasionally for coffee. But I have found a warm and inviting professional group in my area. These folks are passionate about the same things that I am, and I've been frequenting the group's meet-ups. I now even pay for a co-working space so that I can spend time with some of the same people during the workday. The culture and the vibe are great, and have been a huge morale boost in my work life.

The problem is that recently a new person has started to come to these meetups. He's kind on the surface, but after a while, he starts making nasty racist jokes and often speaks in a crude manner. He's borderline misogynist and seems to be a political reactionary. When he comes to the meetups, I try to relocate to another table. I haven't confronted him about the jokes because I don't want to rock the boat and cause an unpleasant situation with this group that I care so much about. But if he keeps coming, I don't know if I can keep coming. It would be heartbreaking to let him ruin my experience, however. How can I preserve my experience while also making it clear that his jokes are not okay?

ANSWER: Unfortunately, as you've discovered, a single person can ruin a dynamic. But by the same token, you have agency too. You said that you don't want to cause an unpleasant situation, but from my reading, you're already in such a situation. And I doubt you're the only one to experience discomfort over this. What I would do is: the next time he comes to your table, don't change tables, at least not before confronting him, if needed, in a polite but firm manner. If he makes one of the racist jokes, you can say something like, "Hey, I think that members of X group would find this offensive." Or, "How would you feel if you were in their shoes?" 

This person or others might very well respond by claiming that they're just joking and that you're being too sensitive. But if this happens, then you can say things like, "I know that different people have different brands of humor, but these jokes are dehumanizing, and I don't find them funny." Or, "These jokes cross a line for me, and I'm not comfortable with that. I want this space to remain a place where everyone feels included and can have a good time. Can you please refrain from making these jokes while I'm around?"

A lot will depend not only on how this person responds but also on how others in the group respond, particularly the leadership. If, after taking your concerns to the person in question, the situation still isn't improving, then you might want to take your concerns to the leadership. But if the leadership brushes it off or justifies the jokes in some way, even by just saying, "Oh, they're just joking around, they're not being serious," then I would reconsider what kind of culture these leaders are creating. I know this group is important to you, but I would wager that your integrity is as well. Life sometimes forces us to make hard choices between our integrity and other things that matter to us. I hope this isn't the case, but unfortunately, this might be one of those situations.

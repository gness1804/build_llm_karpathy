==================================================
QUESTION:  I’ve been married for two years, and I’ve noticed that my husband tends to give me a hard time. His family is very close to him, even though they’re not in the same orbit as me. I’ve noticed that his family usually gets along well with me, even if he’s not in the same orbit as them. I’ve also noticed that he tends to take our shifts well. Sometimes I feel like he’s always at my side when I’m in the middle of something important. I’m worried that if we do go out together, he might find that I don’t appreciate it enough. I’m worried that his family might pressure me into not doing something that benefits them, or that I might be overreacting because we’re in a similar orbit. How do I change our relationship without losing my trust?

ANSWER: Start by asking yourself the following: “Why don’t you stay with him?” Then ask yourself why you’re in a different orbit. He may be in a similar orbit, or he may be in a different orbit because he is more close to the family. You’re not trying to change his orbit, but asking yourself whether he’s comfortable with your decision.

If he says “I understand that you’re not in the same orbit as them

QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: First, it’s important to recognize that setting limits around caregiving does not make you a terrible child. It makes you a human being with boundaries, needs, and limits. Your dad’s health is declining, and that is a heavy burden to bear alone. It’s not your responsibility to do everything, and it’s not a reflection of your love for your dad if you say no to something. It’s a reflection of your humanity.

Second, it’s important to recognize that your siblings are not “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” They are making a choice not to help. It’s not your job to fix that. It’s your job to set limits and take care of yourself.

Third, it’s important to recognize that your dad would want you to take care of yourself. He would want you to set limits and say no when you need to. He would want you to have a life outside of caregiving. He would want you to be happy.

Fourth, it’s important to recognize that you are not alone. There are resources available to help you. There are support groups, respite care, and other services that can help you. You don’t have to do this alone.

Finally, it’s important to recognize that setting limits is not a one-time thing. It’s a process. It’s something you have to do over and over again. It’s something you have to do with your siblings, with your dad, and with yourself. It’s hard, but it’s necessary.

So, how do you set limits without feeling like a terrible child? You start by recognizing that you are not a terrible child. You are a human being with boundaries, needs, and limits. You start by recognizing that your siblings are making a choice not to help. You start by recognizing that your dad would want you to take care of yourself. You start by recognizing that you are not alone. And you start by recognizing that setting limits is a process. It's hard, but it's necessary.

Score: 6.0
Reason: This response directly addresses the question and maintains second person throughout. It reassures that setting limits is not abandoning dad and mentions resources (support groups, respite care). However, the response is somewhat formulaic with its numbered list structure ("First... Second... Third..."), which feels less natural than ideal examples. It doesn't explicitly recognize "invisible labor" as mentioned in the test prompt criteria, and while it mentions resources, it doesn't provide concrete task redistribution suggestions. The voice is decent but lacks the nuanced compassion, warmth, and sophisticated reasoning found in the reference examples. The repetitive "You start by recognizing..." structure at the end feels mechanical. While it shows evidence of attempting to answer the question, it doesn't fully match the ideal voice's sophistication and depth.

QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: It's a tough spot to be in, and I'm sorry you're feeling so overwhelmed. The first thing to remember is that your dad's health is a family issue, not just yours. It's not just about what you can handle, but what's fair and sustainable for everyone involved. Your siblings' expressions of gratitude are nice, but they don't replace actual help. You're not a terrible child for wanting to set limits; you're a human being with limits. It's okay to say, "I can't do this all by myself anymore. I need you to take on X, Y, and Z." If they say they're too busy, ask them to be honest about what they can realistically do. If they say they're not good at certain tasks, offer to show them how. You're not asking them to be perfect; you're asking them to be present. Setting limits doesn't mean you're abandoning your dad; it means you're taking care of yourself so you can be there for him in the long run.

Score: 6.5
Reason: This response directly addresses the question and provides practical advice. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and reassures that setting limits is not abandoning dad. It provides some concrete suggestions (asking siblings to take on specific tasks, offering to show them how). However, the response is quite short and lacks the depth and development found in ideal examples. It doesn't explicitly recognize "invisible labor" as mentioned in the test prompt criteria, and it doesn't mention external help options. The voice is decent but lacks the nuanced compassion, warmth, and sophisticated reasoning found in the reference examples. While it shows evidence of attempting to answer the question, it feels somewhat surface-level and doesn't fully match the ideal voice's sophistication.

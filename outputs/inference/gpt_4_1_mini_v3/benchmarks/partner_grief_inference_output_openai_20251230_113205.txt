QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

==================================================
ANSWER: You’re in a difficult position, and I’m sorry you’re going through this. Grief is a profound and often isolating experience, and it’s not uncommon for people to retreat inward as a way of coping. Your partner’s withdrawal is not a reflection of his feelings for you but rather a manifestation of his struggle with loss. That said, your feelings of loss and confusion are valid and deserve acknowledgment.

It’s important to create a space where both of you can express your feelings without judgment or pressure. You might say something like, “I see that you’re hurting, and I want to be here for you. I’m also struggling with how things have changed between us, and I want to find a way to navigate this together.” This approach communicates empathy and vulnerability, which can encourage him to open up.

You might also consider suggesting couples counseling as a way to facilitate communication. Sometimes, having a neutral third party can help both of you articulate your feelings and needs more clearly.

Lastly, take care of yourself. Grief is a shared experience in a relationship, but it doesn't mean you have to suffer in silence. Reach out to friends, family, or support groups to help you process your own feelings. You're not alone in this, even if it feels that way at times.

Score: 7.5
Reason: This response directly addresses the question and maintains second person throughout. It effectively acknowledges that the partner's grief is real and not "wrong," and it provides meaningful space for the letter writer's grief about the relationship. It suggests outside support (couples counseling, friends, family, support groups) without forcing it, and provides concrete communication scripts. However, the response is somewhat short and lacks the depth and development found in ideal examples. It doesn't explicitly mention "small rituals of connection" as suggested in the test prompt criteria. The voice is decent but lacks the nuanced warmth, sophisticated reasoning, and depth found in the reference examples. While it's a meaningful answer that addresses the question, it doesn't fully match the ideal voice's sophistication.

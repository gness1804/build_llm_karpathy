QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: You are not a terrible child for setting limits. You are a human being with limits. You are not a superhero. You are not a martyr. You are not a doormat. You are a person who loves your dad and wants to help him, but who also needs to take care of yourself. You are a person who deserves to have your needs met, too. You are a person who deserves to have your boundaries respected.

Setting limits is not abandoning your dad. Setting limits is loving your dad enough to take care of yourself, so that you can be there for him in the long run. Setting limits is not saying no to your dad; it is saying yes to yourself. Setting limits is not saying no to your siblings; it is saying yes to your dad.

You can set limits by being clear, direct, and specific. You can say something like, "I love Dad and I want to help him, but I am exhausted and I need some help. Can you please take over X, Y, and Z? If you can't, can you please help me find someone who can?" You can say something like, "I appreciate your gratitude, but I need more than words. I need action. I need you to step up and share the load. I need you to be a partner, not a spectator."

You can set limits by being firm, consistent, and persistent. You can say something like, "I have asked you before, and I am asking you again. I need you to help me with Dad. I need you to be there for him. I need you to be there for me." You can say something like, "I am not going to do everything by myself. I am not going to be the only one who cares. I am not going to be the only one who acts."

You can set limits by being compassionate, understanding, and forgiving. You can say something like, "I know you are busy. I know you have your own lives. I know you have your own struggles. But Dad is our dad. He is our responsibility. He is our family. He is our love." You can say something like, "I forgive you for not being there before. I forgive you for not being there now. But I need you to be there from now on. I need you to be there for Dad. I need you to be there for me."

You can set limits by being realistic, practical, and flexible. You can say something like, "I know you can't do everything. I know you can't do everything perfectly. I know you can't do everything all the time. But you can do something. You can do something sometimes. You can do something that matters." You can say something like, "I am not asking for perfection. I am not asking for miracles. I am asking for help. I am asking for love. I am asking for family."

You can set limits by being hopeful, optimistic, and courageous. You can say something like, "I believe in you. I believe in us. I believe in Dad. I believe in family. I believe in love." You can say something like, "I am scared. I am tired. I am overwhelmed. But I am not alone. I am not alone. I am not alone."

You can set limits by being yourself. You can set limits by being human. You can set limits by being a child who loves their dad and wants to help him, but who also needs to take care of themselves.

Score: 5.0
Reason: This response addresses the question and maintains second person throughout, but it suffers from significant problems. The response is extremely repetitive and formulaic, using the same "You can set limits by..." structure repeatedly throughout. This creates a mechanical, template-like feel that doesn't match the natural, nuanced voice of ideal examples. While it reassures that setting limits is not abandoning dad and provides some concrete scripts, the repetitive structure undermines the quality. It doesn't explicitly recognize "invisible labor" or mention external help options. The voice lacks the depth, warmth, and sophisticated reasoning found in the reference examples. The excessive repetition makes it feel like the model is trying to fill space rather than provide meaningful, well-developed advice.

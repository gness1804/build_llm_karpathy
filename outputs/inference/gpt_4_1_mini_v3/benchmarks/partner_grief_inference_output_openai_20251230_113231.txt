PROMPT:
QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

ANSWER: The death of a close family member can change a person in profound ways, and it sounds like your partner is still processing his grief in a way that is difficult for you to witness. You are right to say that grief does not follow a schedule, but it is also true that grief can create distance between people who care about each other. You are not alone in feeling like you have lost your partner, even if he is still physically present.

One way to support your partner is to acknowledge the loss and the pain that it has caused. You can say something like, “I know you are hurting, and I want you to know that I am here for you.” You can also ask him what he needs from you, whether it is space, time, or someone to talk to. You can also offer to do things together that might help him feel more connected, such as going for a walk, cooking a meal, or watching a movie.

At the same time, you need to honor your own feelings and needs. You can say something like, “I am hurting too, and I need to talk about it.” You can also seek support from friends, family, or a therapist who can help you process your own grief and loneliness. You can also set boundaries with your partner if you feel that his distance is affecting your well-being. For example, you can say something like, “I need you to be more present with me, even if it is just for a few minutes a day.”

Grief is a complex and individual process, and there is no right or wrong way to grieve. What matters is that you and your partner find a way to grieve together, or at least alongside each other, without losing sight of the love and connection that brought you together in the first place.

Score: 8.0
Reason: This response directly addresses the question and maintains second person throughout. It effectively acknowledges that the partner's grief is real and not "wrong," and it provides meaningful space for the letter writer's grief about the relationship. It suggests outside support (therapist) without forcing it, and importantly, it mentions "going for a walk, cooking a meal, or watching a movie" which addresses the "small rituals of connection" criterion from the test prompt. The response provides concrete communication scripts and shows good understanding of the complexity. The voice is decent and more developed than the other two v3 outputs. While it doesn't fully match the nuanced warmth and sophisticated reasoning of the ideal examples, it's a meaningful answer that addresses the question well with better coverage of the criteria.

## Score Justifications

caretaking burnout in a family system: "The v3 fine-tuned model outputs show issues compared to the base model and v2:
1. Repetitive, formulaic structures (especially File 2)
2. Less depth and development than ideal examples
3. Missing key elements like "invisible labor" recognition and external help suggestions
4. Voice lacks the nuanced warmth and sophisticated reasoning of the reference examples
File 1 is the strongest of the three, but all three fall short of the base model (8.5 average) and v2 fine-tuned model (8.0 average) outputs. The v3 model appears to be producing more mechanical, less natural responses.
Scores and justifications have been added to each file."

partners grief and emotional distance: "The v3 fine-tuned model's partner grief outputs are stronger than its caretaking outputs (7.7 vs 5.8 average), but still fall short of:
- Base model (8.7 average)
- v2 fine-tuned model (8.5 average)
The v3 outputs are more coherent and less repetitive than the caretaking ones, but they still lack the depth, warmth, and nuanced reasoning of the reference examples. File 3 is the strongest because it explicitly mentions small rituals of connection."

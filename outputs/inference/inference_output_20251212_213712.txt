Prompt: QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year. We get along well, but I have one recurring complaint. When I tell him about something that hurt my feelings, he makes a joke or says I am “too sensitive.” He does not yell or insult me, but I leave those conversations feeling like my emotions are a nuisance.

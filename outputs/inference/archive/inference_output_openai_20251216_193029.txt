QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

ANSWER: You are not alone in feeling this way. Grief can create a chasm between people, even when both are mourning. Your partner is clearly overwhelmed, but your emotional needs have not disappeared just because his do not align with a typical timeline. The first step is to name this reality: “I know you are going through a lot, and I want to support you. At the same time, I feel like we have drifted apart, and I miss you. I need to find a way to be close to you again.”

Then ask a direct but gentle question: “Can you help me understand what you need from me right now? And can I tell you what I need from you?” This opens a two-way street of communication

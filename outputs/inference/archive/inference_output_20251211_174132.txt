Prompt: QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year. We get along well, but I have one recurring complaint. When I tell him about something that hurt my feelings, he makes a joke or says I am “too sensitive.” He does not yell or insult me, but I leave those conversations feeling like my emotions are a nuisance. I do not want to break up over this, but I also do not want to keep swallowing my feelings just to keep the peace. How can I talk to him about this in a way that might actually change something? \n\nANSWER:

 Start by asking yourself what you think your friend is doing wrong—not simply whether they're being too aggressive toward someone else (or if there's any reason why), nor how much of their behavior would help them feel better without his support. This isn't an argument against sharing space with others; it's trying to understand where these boundaries come from rather than fighting back every time we disagree.
The key here is understanding when each partner feels attacked more often because of personal issues instead out-of their own comfort zone. For example.—You don't need constant reminders on social media before talking openly whenever possible. You may find some moments during conversation which reflect poorly upon who was right at the beginning, such as 'hey dad…I thought our son had cancer.' Or maybe "my mom has always hated us." But sometimes shared experiences matter evenhandedly so long after everyone knows exactly whose fault happened first. Maybe she doesn´re proud enough now to say her daughter died due entirelyto chemotherapy given its impact on both sides. That could be problematic since most people will either never admit responsibility themselves within days, then react defensively afterward while acknowledging guilt later through apologies alone. The goal should be clarity around whom lies behind things though neither side wants framed negatively once confronted. Something similar happens across family dynamics between adults involved in sibling relationships — siblings getting emotional early into life whereas parents setting expectations late throughout childhoods tend¯d to end quickly thereafter. Understanding resentment shouldn\\rrieve discomforting memories until done

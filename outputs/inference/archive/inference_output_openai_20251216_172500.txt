QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: You are not a terrible child. You are a responsible adult who has been carrying more than your fair share of a difficult load. Your siblings’ expressions of gratitude do not replace actual help. It is time to have a direct conversation with them, ideally together, about the reality of the situation. Explain that you cannot continue to manage everything alone and that your dad’s needs will only increase. Be specific about what needs to be shared: one sibling handles transportation, another manages medication refills, another attends certain appointments. Make it clear that “too busy” is not an acceptable reason—this is about prioritizing family.

If they continue to refuse, you may need to involve your dad (if he is able) in deciding what level of support each sibling provides. Sometimes hearing it from the parent helps. You might also consider hiring professional help—a visiting nurse, a home health aide, or a care coordinator—to reduce the burden on all of you. This is not abandoning your father; it is ensuring that his care is sustainable and that you do not burn out. Remember, you cannot pour from an empty cup. Setting boundaries now will allow you to continue to be present for your father in a meaningful way, rather than being overwhelmed and resentful.

PROMPT:
QUESTION: Recently, I had a relationship with a guy. I'm a 31-year-old female, and he's a 32-year-old male. Things were going pretty well. We had been dating for about six months, and so it looked like the relationship had a firm foundation. However, out of the blue, he told me that he needs to "take a pause." He further explains that he needs to work on himself a bit, and he wants to spend more time with his family. I asked what he means by taking a pause, but he didn't respond. I also texted and left a voicemail, but he ghosted me. He gave me complete radio silence for six weeks. After a week or two, I came to assume that he was no longer interested in the relationship, and I moved on. I got a dog even though he had said he was allergic to dogs because I figured that he wasn't in my life anyway, so that wasn't a factor anymore. \n\n Last week, he texts me out of nowhere and wants to pick up where we had left off. That is, before he took the "pause." I told him, "What are you talking about? We're broken up." And I mentioned that I had gotten a dog, among other life changes that I had made. He was very upset, asking me how I could do that when he had explained previously his dog allergies. Am I on the wrong here? Was I wrong to assume that six weeks of ghosting equals a relationship effectively being over?

ANSWER: You're not wrong to assume that six weeks of ghosting equals a relationship being over. Ghosting, by definition, is ending a relationship by ceasing all communication without explanation. If he wanted a temporary break or "pause," he needed to communicate that clearly and agree upon it with you. His behavior—telling you he wants a pause, then ghosting you for six weeks—is contradictory and unfair. You can't take a pause and simultaneously ghost someone for over a month. That's just ending the relationship without being honest about it. So, no, you're not wrong to move on after that. And you're definitely not wrong to get a dog after he ghosted you, even if he had said he was allergic. His needs don't trump yours when he's not even communicating with you. If he was truly committed to the relationship and needed a pause, he would have told you that directly and agreed upon the terms with you. But instead, he just disappeared. So, I would say he's the one who's in the wrong here, not you. You deserve better than someone who ghosts you for six weeks and then expects you to pick up where you left off as if nothing happened.

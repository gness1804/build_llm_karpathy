Prompt: QUESTION: I am in my late twenties and recently moved into my own place. My mom has a key for emergencies, which I was fine with. Lately she has started “dropping by” unannounced when I am at work to leave food, do small chores, or reorganize things “to help.” She means well, but it feels like my space is not really mine. I tried joking about it, but she did not get the hint. How do I set a boundary without hurting her feelings? \n\nANSWER:

 Start off simple—stay away from unnecessary interruptions while you are doing your job so that they don't feel intrusive. Try asking yourself these questions slowly rather than obsessively over them until both of us have our answers (or maybe even two).
You might also consider setting boundaries around stress relief before moving out if there isn´t one on-the go anymore. For example…maybe after school breaks up/cleaning dishes together every morning during lunchtime instead of just getting back home each evening afterward! Something similar can be done later this year as long he doesn\\\'re constantly interrupted whenever we need him to recharge his batteries either alone within minutes because everyone else does their jobs too much anyway. You may find comfort where frustration levels aren&r high enough; however make sure those patterns stay consistent throughout the relationship regardless whether people respond poorly toward specific situations such household tasks themselves or through family members who tend stereotypically blame others outside of relationships entirely. This will give context more effectively then forcing someone deeper down onto what makes sense now versus feeling rejected right next door once again due only marginally less effort today vs tomorrow since neither party seems aware of how important connection truly is yet somehow still underappreciated beyond repair . Remember though, no matter whose fault something goes wrong here, anything changes quickly unless change happens fast–not overnightness based on failure per se , nor upon "adaptive" behavior patterning style shifts initiated soon thereafter….you cannot expect anyone to adapt instantly towards new life experiences

QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

You are not asking him to grieve on a timeline; you are asking him to acknowledge that both of you are navigating a changed emotional landscape.

Start by naming your own vulnerability: “I know you are going through a lot, and I want to support you. At the same time, I feel distant from you, and I miss the connection we had. Can we talk about how we can be there for each other during this time?” This shifts the conversation from “Why are you acting this

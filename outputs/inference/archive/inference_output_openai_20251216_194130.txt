QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

ANSWER: Begin by naming both truths. “I know you are grieving, and I want to support you. At the same time, I feel distant from you and I am hurting too.” Grief can make people withdraw, but it can also make partners feel abandoned. You are not asking him to speed up the process. You are asking for a way to stay connected while he navigates it.

Try a gentle invitation rather than a demand. “I don’t need long conversations, but I would like a few minutes each day where we check in. Even if you say you are still processing, I want to know you are here with me.” Many people in grief do not realize how their silence affects those around them. You are not asking him

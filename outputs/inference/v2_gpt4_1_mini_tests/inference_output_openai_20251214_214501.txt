PROMPT:
QUESTION: I am in my late twenties and recently moved into my own place. My mom has a key for emergencies, which I was fine with. Lately she has started “dropping by” unannounced when I am at work to leave food, do small chores, or reorganize things “to help.” She means well, but it feels like my space is not really mine. I tried joking about it, but she did not get the hint. How do I set a boundary without hurting her feelings?

ANSWER: It sounds like your mom is trying to be loving and helpful, but the way she's doing it is blurring the line between support and intrusion. You're not wrong to feel unsettled by that.

ANSWER: Have a direct conversation. Something like: “Mom, I appreciate that you want to help, but my home is my space and I need to feel like I have control over it. I’m happy to ask for help when I need it, but I need you to stop coming over unannounced.”

Reassure her that you value her support, but make the boundary clear: she needs to be invited before entering. You might say: “The key is only for emergencies. If you want to drop something off, please call or text first and I’ll let you in.”

If she reacts as if you’re being unreasonable, stay calm and consistent. “I’m not questioning your intentions. I’m just asking for my home to be respected.”

Over time, she will adjust if you don't waver. Boundaries often feel uncomfortable at first because they change the dynamic, but they are necessary for healthy adult relationships. You're teaching her how to love you in a way that actually works for both of you.

Score: 8.5
Reason: This is a strong answer that directly addresses the question about setting boundaries without hurting feelings. The response provides specific, actionable advice with concrete example scripts that the user can adapt, which matches the practical approach seen in tier A examples. It stays on topic throughout, maintains a compassionate and clear-headed tone, and demonstrates empathy by acknowledging the mother's good intentions while firmly establishing the necessary boundary. The advice is well-structured, moving from the direct conversation to reassurance to handling potential pushback, and ends with a thoughtful reflection on the purpose of boundaries. The voice closely matches the ideal examples from tier_a_examples.md—compassionate, practical, and direct. The only minor gap from perfection is that it could perhaps include slightly more of the reflective, nuanced quality seen in some tier A examples, but overall this is an excellent response that seriously attempts to and largely succeeds in answering the original question.

PROMPT:
QUESTION: A close friend of mine has recently become very religious after not being interested in faith at all for years. I am genuinely glad that she has found something that gives her meaning, but our conversations now feel like sales pitches. She keeps inviting me to services and small groups, and when I politely say no, she tells me she is “worried about my soul.” I do not want to attack her beliefs, and I do not want to lose the friendship, but I feel cornered. How can I set a boundary without sounding hostile?

ANSWER: Begin by affirming the friendship and her sincerity. Something like: “I’m glad that your faith is meaningful to you, and I value our friendship. But I need you to understand that the invitations and comments about my soul are making me uncomfortable.”

Be direct but gentle. Then set a clear limit: “I’m not interested in attending services or faith events, and I need you to stop inviting me. I respect your beliefs, and I ask that you respect my boundary.”

If she responds with guilt or pressure, stay steady: “I know you’re coming from a place of care, but this is crossing a line for me. Our friendship can’t continue if this keeps happening.”

You're not rejecting her faith. You're rejecting a pattern of behavior that feels intrusive. A true friend will adjust once they understand the impact.

PROMPT:
QUESTION: I have done some damage, and I am not sure how to fix it. My wife and I have a 41-year-old, very obese daughter. There have been health issues. Wife says we cannot talk about it, so we don’t. We are financially secure, our daughter is not, and we occasionally help her with extraordinary expenses.\n So, despite Wife’s position, I emailed Daughter that I read that Costco was discounting weight-loss drugs to $499 per month and offered to pay for it. I included this: “Please know that I do not wish to be critical of you in any way. I am concerned about the morbidity effects of your weight, and I want you to be around to enjoy your inheritance!” \nThere was no response. Three weeks later, Daughter tells Wife that her doctor recommended weight-loss drugs and asks Wife to pay for them. Daughter says she would rather I not know, but under no circumstances does she want to discuss this with me. I spend the rest of that day wondering what I have done. Wife asks what’s wrong. Not knowing what else to do, I tell her. It does not go well. Wife is very frustrated with me that I “just cannot understand a woman’s relationship with her body.” \n Thanksgiving comes, and Daughter tells Wife she is too busy to make her usual 120-mile trip home. On Thursday, she texts her mother, “Happy Thanksgiving! Thankful you are my mom.” For me, nothing. No communication at all for the last two months. I have never been disappeared before. \n Right now, my objective is to repair my relationship with my daughter. I know you and your readers must chronicle my failures as a father and husband, but please leave some space for some practical advice. I could just be quiet and wait for the chance to apologize if I thought that would work. However, this feels like a deeper wound, one that could fester and grow worse if not treated. What to do? (This is not to dig my hole deeper — I have my wife’s permission to post this.)

ANSWER: I am sure your daughter’s hurt is deeper than just the email about the weight-loss drugs, but that email certainly did not help. It was critical, even if you did not intend it to be. And it violated your wife’s boundary about not discussing your daughter’s weight. \nSo, first, you need to apologize to your daughter for that email. And you need to do it without any justification or explanation. Just a simple apology: “I am sorry for the email I sent about the weight-loss drugs. It was inappropriate, and I should not have sent it. I love you and I respect you, and I am sorry for any hurt I caused.” \nSend that by email. Do not expect a response. Then, for the love of God, do not mention her weight again unless she brings it up. Your wife is right that you do not understand a woman’s relationship with her body. None of us do, not even women themselves. It is a deeply personal and often fraught matter. Your daughter has made it clear that she does not want to discuss her weight with you. That is her right. And frankly, it is not your business unless she makes it your business. \nRight now, what she needs from you is unconditional love and support. That means being there for her when she needs help, without making it about her weight. It means celebrating her for who she is, not for how much she weighs. It means respecting her boundaries, even when they are hard for you to understand. \nYou mentioned that she is financially insecure and that you occasionally help her with extraordinary expenses. That seems like the right approach. Keep doing that as needed. But do it without any commentary about her weight. Just say, “We want to help you with this expense.” \n And remember, this is a long game. You have probably been making your daughter feel bad about her weight for most of her life, even if you were just trying to help. Now you need to spend years undoing that damage. Be patient. Be consistent. And above all, be loving.

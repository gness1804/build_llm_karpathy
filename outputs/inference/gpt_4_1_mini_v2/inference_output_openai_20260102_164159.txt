QUESTION: My wife and I are facing a quandary concerning faith. When we met, we were at a somewhat different place regarding religion, but we felt that we were basically compatible. Long story short, she believes in God, I don't, but we both have the same basic values. I let her know of my leanings early on, and she was always accepting. She comes from a very religious family, but questions many aspects of organized religions, particularly the one that she was raised in. We went through a rough patch with her parents accepting me because of the religious issues, but we moved beyond that.\n\nNow, however, we seem to be moving in opposite directions. If you can imagine a 0-to-10 scale with respect to warmth towards religion, with 0 being completely cold to religion and 10 being extremely accepting, as of this time a year ago, I was probably about a 4 while she was a 6 or 7. But now she's probably an 8 or a 9, while I'm a 2. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is the current political climate in this country, I'm feeling even more turned off by religion than I was a year or two ago. But at the same time, she's interested in re-exploring the faith she grew up in. She's even singing in a church choir and has been for a few months. Recently, I saw a cross which had been banished to our garage, now in our guest bedroom on the bed.\n\nHow can we accommodate this difference? We haven't had any arguments over it yet, but I feel that there's some tension. I want to respect her faith and her own spiritual decisions, but my allergic reaction to religion makes that difficult. How can we both coexist under the same roof with different attitudes towards religion?

ANSWER: It sounds like you and your wife are navigating a deeply personal and evolving part of your relationship, and that can bring up a mix of emotions—curiosity, discomfort, hope, and perhaps even some unease. It’s clear that you both care about each other and want to honor each other’s experiences, even as your paths diverge in this area. The fact that you’ve maintained respect and openness so far is a meaningful foundation.

Living with differing views on something as intimate as faith can feel like walking a delicate line. Your feelings of being “allergic” to religion are valid and important to acknowledge, just as her renewed interest and participation in her faith community are significant to her. It’s natural for tension to arise when something so central to identity and values shifts, even if it’s subtle or unspoken.

One way to approach this might be to create small, intentional spaces where each of you can express what this part of your lives means without fear of judgment or pressure. This doesn’t mean you need to agree or even fully understand each other’s perspectives, but simply that you recognize the importance of these feelings and choices. It’s also okay to set gentle boundaries around what feels comfortable for you, while remaining curious about what brings her joy and meaning.

Remember, coexistence doesn’t require uniformity. Sometimes, it’s about holding two different truths in the same space and allowing each other the freedom to explore and grow. This might mean accepting that some days feel more challenging than others, and that’s part of the ongoing dance of partnership.

Your awareness of the tension before it escalates is a strength. It opens the door to ongoing conversations—ones that don’t have to solve everything but can deepen your understanding of each other’s inner worlds. In time, you may find new ways to support each other that honor both your boundaries and your connection.

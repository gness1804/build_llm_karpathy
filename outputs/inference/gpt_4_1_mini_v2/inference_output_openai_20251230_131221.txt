QUESTION: I have been friends with Steve for a long time. We met at work, and we hang out often. The problem is that he has recently joined a new church. He's become very aggressive in asking me to attend and in trying to explain to me the 'glories of God.' I respect his belief, but I have no wish to join his church. I've informed him of this, but he persists. What can I say to him to convince him that I am not interested without ruining the friendship?

ANSWER: While I respect his beliefs, I have no wish to join his church. I've informed him of this, but he persists.

Steve is clearly overstepping, but I don't want to ruin the friendship. What can I say to convince him that I'm not interested without damaging our relationship?

ANSWER: You've told him that you're not interested, but he continues to push you. This suggests that he's not respecting your boundaries. You can try to preserve the friendship while still being firm with him. Say something like, "Steve, I respect your beliefs, but I've told you that I'm not interested in joining your church. I need you to stop bringing it up. Our friendship is important to me, and I want us to be able to talk about other things without this being a point of tension."

If he continues to push after that, then the problem isn't just the church discussions—it's that he's not respecting your boundaries. In that case, you might need to reconsider how much time you want to spend with someone who doesn't respect your wishes, even on something as seemingly small as a religious discussion. Because if he can't respect you on this, what makes you think he'll respect you on other matters?

INSTRUCTION: You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a response that meets the following criteria? Empathetic but generic, lacks clarity or depth, feels "LLM-like". Lacks a distinctive human voice. May include things like a bulleted or numbered "laundry list" of solutions. Responses in this range are usually short and are rather shallow, rather than fully engaging with the complex issues that are present in advice column problems.

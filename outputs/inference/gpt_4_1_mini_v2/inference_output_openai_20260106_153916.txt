INSTRUCTION: You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Medium quality response that meets the following criteria: Generally solid advice with minor softness, vagueness, or missed opportunities for specificity. Some of the moral clarity of a 9-10 response may be missing. The response might be fairly described as "pulling its punches" in places.

QUESTION: My wife comes from a large, close-knit family, while I come from a much smaller family. Sometimes it seems like I have lived through "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." But movie references aside, this has resulted in cultural adaptations for both of us. Geography also shapes our interactions with our respective families, especially around the holidays. Her family is mostly local. Most live within an hour's driving radius. By contrast, my family is very spread out. By "spread out", I mean that I need to get on a plane to see three of my four immediate family members. And there's no destination I can go to where I will be within 200 miles of more than one of my immediate family members. As you can imagine, this means we spend most holidays with her family. It just makes logistical sense, especially because traveling over the holidays is such a nightmare. But at the same time, I feel that this is a bit inequitable. I grew up assuming that my wife and I would alternate families to visit for the holidays, as a lot of people do. For instance, we see her family for Thanksgiving, I see hers for Christmas, then do it the reverse the following year. But the distance makes this impractical. I also have limited time off from work, and we like to travel outside of the holidays for leisure purposes as well. How can we heed logistical realities while making things fairer?

ANSWER: It sounds like you and your wife are navigating a complex situation where geography, family size, and traditions all intersect, making holiday plans feel more complicated than they might for other couples. It’s understandable that you feel the current arrangement leans more toward her family, especially since spending most holidays with one side can create a sense of imbalance over time.

Given the travel challenges and limited time off, alternating holidays in the traditional way might not be realistic, but there are still ways to create a sense of fairness and inclusion. One approach could be to have a conversation with your wife about what “fair” means to both of you beyond just the holidays themselves. For example, could you plan visits to your family at other meaningful times during the year, even if they don’t fall on major holidays? This might help you feel more connected without the stress of holiday travel.

Another possibility is to explore ways to involve your family in the holidays you spend with her family, whether through virtual calls, sharing photos, or even inviting some of your family to join if feasible. This could help blend the traditions and make the holidays feel more inclusive.

Ultimately, it’s important to acknowledge that perfect equity might be hard to achieve given the circumstances, but striving for a balance that respects both your needs and feelings is key. Keeping the conversation open and flexible as your lives and work schedules evolve can help you find solutions that feel right for both of you.

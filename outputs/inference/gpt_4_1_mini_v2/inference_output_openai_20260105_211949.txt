QUESTION: My husband and I are facing a dilemma over how to respond to a problem with how his family treats his brother. We both have long suspected that my husband's brother is gay. At one point, the brother even came to my husband asking for advice on how to come out of the closet. However, in large part because of their family's attitudes, the brother has never actually come out to them. From time to time, I overhear some of my husband's family, particularly my father-in-law, make offensive and cruel remarks about gay people. I don't know if the father-in-law suspects that one of his sons is gay or not, but regardless, this creates an alienating environment for us and obviously especially for the brother.\n\nOur dilemma is on how to respond to this, if at all. I would like for us, or at least for my husband, to bring this up with his father and to make clear that we don't approve of these cruel remarks. My husband has made it clear that even though he strongly disapproves of the anti-gay remarks, he wants to preserve his relationship with his father and doesn't want to intervene. I tend to feel that since it's his family, he should have more of a say on how to engage with them. But it really hurts to stand by and say nothing while my husband's father creates such an intolerant environment. Do you think that we should just let this go or do you feel that it's worth risking our relationship with his father to try to improve the situation?

ANSWER: This is a deeply painful and complex situation, and your feelings of hurt and frustration are entirely understandable. When a family environment feels alienating or hostile—especially around something as personal and vulnerable as sexual identity—it can create a heavy emotional burden for everyone involved, including your husband and his brother.

Your husband’s desire to maintain his relationship with his father while disapproving of the hurtful remarks reflects a common and difficult balancing act: wanting to protect family bonds but also wanting to stand against intolerance. It’s important to recognize that this tension is not a simple matter of choosing between silence and confrontation. It’s a negotiation of values, safety, and emotional survival.

You are right to feel that the environment created by these remarks is harmful, and it’s reasonable to want to address that harm. At the same time, your husband’s hesitation suggests that he may be weighing the potential consequences of speaking up—perhaps fearing that confrontation could lead to estrangement or deepen the family’s divisions. His perspective deserves respect, even as you hold your own.

One way forward might be to explore together what “engaging” with his father could look like in a way that feels authentic but also manageable. It doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing confrontation. Sometimes, small, steady expressions of disapproval or gentle challenges to harmful remarks can open a door without closing the relationship. Your husband might find a way to communicate his feelings that feels less risky or more aligned with his style and comfort level.

It’s also worth considering the impact on the brother, who remains in a vulnerable position. Supporting him—whether through private conversations, creating safe spaces, or simply being a consistent source of acceptance—can be a powerful form of resistance to the family’s intolerance.

Ultimately, there is no perfect answer here. You and your husband will need to navigate this together, balancing your values, your emotional needs, and the realities of your family dynamics. It’s okay to acknowledge that some situations resist quick fixes and that protecting your own well-being is a valid part of the equation. If the environment remains intolerant and unchanged, it’s also okay to set boundaries around your involvement or presence in those family interactions.

Your desire for a kinder, more accepting family space is both compassionate and courageous. Finding a path that honors that desire while respecting your husband’s approach will take time, patience, and ongoing conversation.

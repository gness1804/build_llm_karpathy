QUESTION: My partner says I'm "too independent" and that it makes him feel unnecessary. I don't see independence as a flaw, but he seems genuinely hurt. How do I respond without apologizing for who I am?

ANSWER: It’s clear you value your independence, and that’s an important part of who you are. At the same time, your partner’s feelings of hurt suggest that he’s struggling with how your independence affects his sense of connection or role in the relationship. This doesn’t mean you need to apologize for being independent, but it does open a space for mutual understanding.

One way to approach this is to acknowledge his feelings without taking responsibility for them as if they were your fault. For example, you might say something like, “I hear that my independence makes you feel unnecessary, and I want to understand more about what that means for you.” This invites a conversation about what he’s experiencing, rather than shutting down his feelings or changing who you are.

From there, you can explore together what each of you needs to feel valued and connected. Sometimes, independence can be misread as distance or disinterest, even when that’s not the case. Finding ways to show care and involvement that feel authentic to you might help bridge that gap. At the same time, your partner might reflect on why your independence triggers feelings of being unnecessary, which could be about his own insecurities or expectations.

Ultimately, a healthy relationship allows both people to be themselves while also making space for each other’s vulnerabilities. You don’t have to sacrifice your independence, but staying open to dialogue and empathy can help both of you feel more seen and supported. If this dynamic continues to cause pain or misunderstanding, it’s okay to reassess whether your needs and his can coexist in a way that feels respectful and fulfilling for both.

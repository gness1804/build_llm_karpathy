QUESTION: My wife and I have been married for eight years, and we have a good relationship overall. But there's one recurring issue: she's very close with her group of college friends, and they have a group chat where they're constantly messaging. The problem is that they often share very personal details about their lives, including things about their relationships and sex lives. My wife participates in these conversations and sometimes shares details about our relationship that I'm not comfortable with. When I've asked her to keep our private life private, she says I'm being too sensitive and that this is just how her friend group communicates. But I feel like my privacy is being violated, and I don't want our intimate details discussed in a group chat. How do we resolve this?

ANSWER: It’s clear that you value the privacy of your relationship deeply, and that’s a completely reasonable and important boundary to have. At the same time, your wife’s connection with her friends and the way they communicate is a significant part of her social life, and it sounds like this group chat is a space where she feels comfortable sharing and connecting. The tension arises because these two needs—your desire for privacy and her desire for openness with her friends—are coming into conflict.

The first step is to acknowledge that both perspectives have validity. Your discomfort isn’t about being “too sensitive” but about feeling exposed in a way that undermines your sense of safety and trust. Meanwhile, your wife’s sharing is part of how she maintains close friendships, which are important to her well-being.

Resolving this will require a conversation where you both listen carefully and without judgment. You might try to explain what it feels like for you when private details are shared—how it affects your trust and your sense of respect in the relationship—without framing it as an attack on her or her friends. At the same time, invite her to explain what these conversations mean to her and why she feels the need to share.

From there, you can explore practical compromises. For example, she might agree to avoid sharing certain types of intimate details or to check in with you before discussing specific topics. You might also consider whether there are particular boundaries around what is off-limits versus what feels okay to share. It’s not about policing her friendships but about protecting the intimacy you both share.

If this feels difficult to navigate on your own, it can be helpful to set aside time to revisit the conversation regularly, as feelings and boundaries can evolve. Ultimately, the goal is to find a balance where your privacy is respected and your wife’s friendships remain meaningful, without either side feeling dismissed or controlled.

If the pattern persists and your concerns continue to be minimized, it’s worth reflecting on how this dynamic affects your trust and emotional safety in the relationship. Your feelings deserve to be taken seriously, and a healthy partnership involves mutual respect for each other’s boundaries—even when they require some adjustment or discomfort.

INSTRUCTION: You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Medium quality response that meets the following criteria: Generally solid advice with minor softness, vagueness, or missed opportunities for specificity. Some of the moral clarity of a 9-10 response may be missing. The response might be fairly described as "pulling its punches" in places.

QUESTION: I'm black, and my partner is white. We've been dating for about three years. We get along great, and even though we have a few minor issues, I really see a future with my partner. (If it matters, I'm a woman, and he's a man.) But the problem is his family, particularly his parents. His parents have made it clear that they don't approve of us as a couple. They are polite to me when I interact with them, but reading between the lines, I can see that they're not happy. There's a lot of tension, and my partner reports to me that when I'm not present, they make racist remarks behind my back. This is causing a lot of tension. \n\nI love my partner and don't want to end this relationship, but I don't think that I can live through decades of hostile relatives. Even though the parents are the worst offenders, some other members of his extended family have expressed similar racist sentiments, so the problem won't end after his parents pass. And I know it's terrible to frame it that way, but the views they expressed are pretty awful, too. We've been talking about getting married, but neither of us has proposed. But given the attitudes of his family, it's hard to envision either a marriage or a long-term, unmarried partnership with him. Is there a way forward for us? Or should I end the relationship now before there's a proposal?

ANSWER: Your situation is deeply challenging, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling torn between your love for your partner and the reality of his family’s hostility. It’s a painful position to be in, especially when the people closest to your partner hold views that are hurtful and unacceptable. The fact that your partner shares what his family says behind your back is important—it shows some level of honesty and perhaps discomfort on his part, but it also raises questions about how he is handling the situation.

One key consideration is how your partner responds to his family’s behavior. Does he stand up to them or try to set boundaries around their racism? Or does he avoid conflict and let their attitudes slide? His willingness and ability to support you and confront his family’s prejudice will likely be crucial in determining whether you can build a future together that doesn’t leave you feeling isolated or disrespected.

It’s also worth reflecting on what you need to feel safe and valued in a relationship. Living with ongoing hostility from family members can be exhausting and damaging over time. If your partner’s family remains a source of pain and your partner is unable or unwilling to address it meaningfully, that will be a heavy burden to carry.

At the same time, ending a relationship solely because of family disapproval is a deeply personal decision. Some couples find ways to navigate difficult family dynamics, sometimes by limiting contact or creating their own supportive networks. Others find that the strain is too great and choose to part ways.

You might consider having a very candid conversation with your partner about the future you both want and how you envision handling his family’s attitudes. It’s important that he understands the impact this has on you and that you both agree on how to approach it together. If he is committed to standing with you and working to change or at least manage the family dynamics, that could be a hopeful sign.

Ultimately, there’s no simple answer, and it’s okay to take your time before making any decisions about proposals or marriage. Your feelings and well-being deserve to be at the center of this. Whatever you decide, it’s important that you feel respected, supported, and safe in your relationship.

QUESTION: Growing up, my sister was always the favorite child. There are two of us, and she's the older one by two and a half years. Consistently, as we went through school and then started our adult lives, our parents would pay more attention to her than to me. Let's call her Rosie. My parents would praise Rosie's grades much more than mine, even though we usually brought home similar report cards throughout our schooling. Rosie also participated in several sports, including swimming, while I leaned towards more academically oriented extracurriculars. Our parents attended almost every one of her athletic events and would give her high praise, even when she or her team didn't do well. By contrast, whenever I would win an academic bowl or a forensics tournament, our parents might give an off-handed "good job" at best. Usually they didn't even seem to notice. \n\nThis is continued into adulthood. When Rosie's first child was born a few years ago, her parents were overjoyed. As one might expect at the birth of a first grandchild, or really any grandchild. They showered her with presents and praise and offered to do whatever she needed when it came to babysitting, etc. (We live only about an hour away from our parents.) But now, I'm expecting my first child, and our parents seem almost like they don't care. They congratulated me at first when I told them the news, but they haven't bestowed anywhere near the attention on me that they did on Rosie during her pregnancy. I shudder to think what will happen once my child is born. I fear that my parents will replicate their dysfunctional favoritism to the next generation, such that my children might start to feel resentful or less than because of their grandparents' behavior. My husband and I have sworn that we would never do that to our children, that we would treat them equally and not engage in favoritism. So we certainly don’t want the grandparents replicating their mistakes with the next generation. \n\nDo you think I should keep grandparents at bay after our children are born? Rosie and I already have a fairly distant relationship, mostly because of what happened as children. I don't want my children to grow up feeling that their worth is any less than anybody else's just because their grandparents can't figure out how to treat children equally. But I do want them to have a meaningful and rich relationship with their grandparents, especially since my own relationship with mine was mine. How should we handle this?

ANSWER: Your concerns are deeply understandable and come from a place of love and protection for your child, which is entirely natural. The pattern of favoritism you experienced growing up is painful, and it’s wise to want to prevent your child from feeling similarly diminished or overlooked. At the same time, your desire for your child to have a meaningful relationship with their grandparents shows a generous hope for connection despite past difficulties.

Navigating this balance will likely require a mix of clear boundaries, open communication, and realistic expectations. It’s important to recognize that your parents’ behavior toward you and Rosie reflects long-standing patterns that may not change easily or quickly. While you cannot control their feelings or actions, you can control how much influence they have over your child’s environment and emotional well-being.

One practical approach is to set boundaries that protect your child from neglect or favoritism without completely shutting out the grandparents. For example, you might limit visits or interactions if you notice your child being ignored or treated unfairly, or you might arrange visits in ways that encourage positive, one-on-one time rather than comparisons. You could also gently but firmly communicate your expectations to your parents, emphasizing the importance of equal attention and respect for your child’s milestones and needs.

It’s also worth preparing your child, as they grow, to understand that family dynamics can be complicated and that their worth is not defined by anyone’s uneven attention or approval. This kind of emotional resilience can be nurtured through your own consistent love and validation.

Given your already distant relationship with Rosie, it may be helpful to keep your focus on your immediate family’s well-being rather than trying to change the entire family dynamic. Your husband and you setting a different example for your children is a powerful way to break the cycle.

Ultimately, keeping grandparents “at bay” doesn’t have to mean exclusion but rather thoughtful management of their involvement. Your child’s emotional safety and sense of being valued can guide how much space you allow for the grandparents in their life. It’s a delicate balance, and it’s okay for your approach to evolve over time as you learn what works best for your family.

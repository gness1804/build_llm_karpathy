QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

ANSWER: Six months after an unexpected death is still relatively early in the grieving process, and many people go inward during this time. Your partner’s withdrawal sounds like a common grief response rather than something you caused or something that will last forever. The challenge, of course, is that while he is processing the loss of his sibling, you are experiencing the loss of the relationship you once had with him. Both are real and both deserve acknowledgment.

You wrote that “no one has named” the fact that you feel like you lost your partner. I think you need to name that to him, using “I” language to avoid making him feel attacked. For example, you might say: “I know you are going through a lot, and I want to be there for you. But I also feel like I lost the partner I used to know, and that is hurting me. I need us to find a way to grieve together rather than each of us grieving alone.” That opens the door to a conversation rather than a confrontation.

The conversation will probably be difficult. He may not be ready to talk, or he may not even realize how his behavior is affecting you. But opening the door is the first step. You can also gently encourage him to seek professional support if the grief seems to be interfering with his ability to engage in life over the long term. And make sure you have your own support system in place, whether that is friends, family, or a therapist. You cannot carry your own hurt while also carrying his, at least not indefinitely. You need to be grounded yourself if you are going to be a true partner in his healing.

Reason: This is a very strong answer that closely matches the ideal voice from the reference file. It demonstrates sophisticated compassion, clear-headedness, and empathy. The response effectively acknowledges that the partner's grief is real and not "wrong," and it provides meaningful space for the letter writer's grief about the relationship. It suggests outside support (professional support, therapist) without forcing it, and emphasizes the letter writer's need for their own support system. The response directly addresses the letter writer's observation that "no one has named" the loss, providing a concrete script for naming it. The voice is nuanced and well-developed. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and provides practical advice. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly mention "small rituals of connection" as suggested in the test prompt criteria, but this is a very strong answer that effectively addresses the question with the right voice and depth.

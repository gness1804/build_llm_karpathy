QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: It is not abandonment to recognize that you cannot do everything alone. What you are describing is not guilt-worthy care, but burnout. Resentment is not a moral failing; it is a signal that a responsibility has become unmanageable.

You need to have a direct conversation with your siblings about sharing the load. Do not let “understood” arrangements continue to exclude them. Be specific about what needs to be done: “Dad has a doctor’s appointment on Thursday at 3 pm. Can you take him?” Or, “We need someone to manage his medication schedule. Can you handle that?” Concrete asks are easier to respond to than vague appeals.

You also need to set boundaries for yourself. That might mean you continue to handle the tasks you are best suited for, but only for a limited number of hours per week. Or it might mean you say, “I cannot drive Dad to every appointment. You will need to take him to some.” The goal is not to be fair in the moment; it is to create a sustainable system so that Dad gets the care he needs over the long term.

And finally, you need to take care of yourself. That might mean hiring professional help, so some of the burden is not on family members who feel resentful or guilty. It might mean taking time off for yourself, or it might mean talking to a therapist about how to manage these complex emotions. Doing so is not abandoning Dad. It is making sure that you can be there for him in a way that is healthy for both of you.

Score: 8.0
Reason: This is a strong, well-structured answer that directly addresses the question with practical advice. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and provides concrete task redistribution suggestions with specific examples (doctor's appointment, medication schedule). The response effectively reassures that setting limits is not abandoning dad and mentions multiple forms of external help (professional help, therapist). The voice is clear-headed and direct, showing good reasoning. However, it doesn't explicitly recognize the "invisible labor" aspect mentioned in the test prompt criteria. The tone is somewhat more direct and less warm than the ideal examples, which tend to have more nuanced compassion and depth. While it's a meaningful answer that addresses the core question well, it doesn't fully match the ideal voice's sophisticated blend of warmth, compassion, and insight.

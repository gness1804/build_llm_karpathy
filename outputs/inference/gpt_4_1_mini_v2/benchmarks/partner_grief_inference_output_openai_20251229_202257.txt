QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

ANSWER: Six months after a sudden death is still relatively early in the grieving process, and many people go through periods of withdrawal as they try to make sense of their loss. Your partner’s distance may be a coping mechanism rather than a reflection of his feelings for you. At the same time, your sense of having lost him in the process is real and deserves acknowledgment. Grief can reshape relationships, often temporarily, but sometimes more permanently. You are both navigating new terrain, and neither of you has a map.

Try to create openings for connection that do not require him to articulate where he is in his grief. Instead of asking “How are you doing?” which can feel like a question with a right answer, try something gentler: “I’m here if you ever want to talk or just be together.” Sometimes people need to know that support is available without being put on the spot. At the same time, make sure you are not postponing your own needs indefinitely. It is not selfish to want companionship, conversation, or emotional presence from the person you live with. You might say something like: “I understand that you’re going through a lot, but I am going through changes too. I need us to find a way to be present with each other again. I’m not asking for you to be ‘fixed’ or to talk about the grief constantly. I’m asking for us to feel like a team again.”

If he continues to withdraw and you feel yourself withdrawing in response, it may be worth suggesting couples counseling. This is not about fixing him but about finding a way to navigate the changed landscape together. A professional can help you both understand what each of you needs and how to meet in the middle. Grief can be isolating, but it does not have to permanently reshape the relationship unless both of you allow it to. You are allowed to want your partner back while also honoring the fact that he is changed. The two truths can coexist.

Score: 8.5
Reason: This is a very strong answer that closely matches the ideal voice from the reference file. It demonstrates sophisticated compassion, clear-headedness, and empathy. The response effectively acknowledges that the partner's grief is real and not "wrong," and it provides meaningful space for the letter writer's grief about the relationship. It suggests outside support (couples counseling) without forcing it, and offers concrete suggestions for offering presence ("I'm here if you ever want to talk or just be together"). The voice is nuanced, well-developed, and shows deep understanding of the complexity. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and provides concrete communication scripts. The only minor gap is that it doesn't explicitly mention "small rituals of connection" as suggested in the test prompt criteria, but this is a very strong answer that effectively addresses the question with the right voice and depth.

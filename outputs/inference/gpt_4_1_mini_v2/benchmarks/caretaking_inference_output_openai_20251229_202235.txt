QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: It is not abandonment to recognize that you cannot do everything alone. What you are describing is a common pattern: one person becomes the default caregiver, while others offer gratitude but do not share the burden. Resentment usually follows, even among the most loving and dutiful people. Guilt often tries to silence those feelings, but guilt alone is not a reason to keep wearing yourself down.

You can honor your dad’s needs and your own limits at the same time. That is not a contradiction; it is sustainability. Start by having a concrete conversation with your siblings: “I cannot manage Dad’s care by myself. We need to divide the responsibilities in a way that each of us can handle.” Be specific about what needs to be done and who can do it. Proximity is a factor, but it is not the only one. Maybe a sibling can handle paperwork, another can visit regularly, you can share medication management. The key is that the load becomes shared, not just acknowledged.

If they resist, you may need to set firmer boundaries: "I will continue to handle these tasks, but only for as long as I can do it safely. If I become too overwhelmed, we will need to hire professional help." Sometimes the prospect of losing the informal system forces families to reconsider how they share care. You are not a terrible child. You are a person who needs support to do a difficult job. Asking for that support is not selfish. It is necessary.

Score: 8.0
Reason: This is a strong, well-developed answer that directly addresses the question with practical advice. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and provides concrete suggestions for task redistribution (paperwork, visits, medication management). The response effectively reassures that setting limits is not abandoning dad and mentions external help (professional help). The voice is clear-headed and direct, showing good reasoning. However, it doesn't explicitly recognize the "invisible labor" aspect mentioned in the test prompt criteria. The tone is somewhat more direct and less warm than the ideal examples, which tend to have more nuanced compassion and depth. While it's a meaningful answer that addresses the core question well, it doesn't fully match the ideal voice's sophisticated blend of warmth, compassion, and insight.

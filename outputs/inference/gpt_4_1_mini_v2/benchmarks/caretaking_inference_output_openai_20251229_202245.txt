QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: It is not abandonment to recognize that you cannot do everything alone. What you are describing is not a guilt dilemma; it is a burnout dilemma. Your father’s needs are great, and they will likely increase. The question is how to meet them in a way that is sustainable and fair, not how to prove that you are the most self-sacrificing child.

Resentment is a signal, not a moral failing. It signals that there is a mismatch between what you are doing and what you feel is reasonable or fair. If you ignore that signal, you risk becoming resentful to the point of withdrawal or even anger that you cannot control. Or worse, you risk letting resentment-colored fatigue degrade the quality of care that you and your dad both need you to provide. Resentment is not telling you to be more virtuous. It is telling you to pay attention to your own limits.

Setting limits is not a one-time conversation. It is a process of adjustment. You might start by saying to your siblings, “I love Dad, and I want to make sure he gets the best care. But I cannot do everything alone. Let’s figure out who can handle what.” Then propose concrete tasks: “Can you take him to his next appointment? Can you manage his medication schedule for a week? Can you handle the paperwork for his insurance?”

If they continue to resist, you might need to get external help: a social worker, a care manager, or someone from Dad’s healthcare team who can explain why shared responsibility is important. This is not about “being fair” to you. It is about making sure Dad gets consistent, reliable care, and that no one person is overwhelmed to the point of collapse.

You are not a terrible child. You are a person who needs to take care of yourself in order to take care of your dad.

Score: 8.5
Reason: This is a very strong answer that directly addresses the question with well-developed, practical advice. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and provides concrete task redistribution suggestions (appointments, medication schedule, insurance paperwork). The response effectively reassures that setting limits is not abandoning dad and suggests external help (social worker, care manager, healthcare team). The voice is clear-headed and shows good reasoning, with particularly strong discussion of resentment as a signal rather than a moral failing. The response is more developed and nuanced than the first one, with better depth of insight. However, it doesn't explicitly recognize the "invisible labor" terminology mentioned in the test prompt criteria, and the tone, while good, doesn't quite match the ideal voice's warmth and sophisticated compassion. It's a meaningful answer that addresses the question very well.

QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: What you’re describing is a deeply familiar and painful dynamic for many families caring for an aging parent. It’s clear you love your dad and want to honor the care he gave you, but the weight of responsibility has fallen heavily on your shoulders, and that exhaustion and resentment are signals that something needs to change.

First, it’s important to recognize that feeling overwhelmed doesn’t make you a bad child or a failure in your role. Taking on nearly all the caregiving tasks is a huge burden, and it’s natural to want—and need—support. Your siblings’ expressions of gratitude, while kind, don’t replace meaningful participation. Their reasons for not stepping in may be genuine, but the result is that you’re left carrying more than your fair share.

Setting limits doesn’t mean abandoning your dad or shirking responsibility; it means protecting your own well-being so you can continue to be present and effective in his care. One way to approach this is to have an honest conversation with your siblings about the reality of the situation. Instead of asking if they can help in vague terms, try to identify specific, manageable tasks that fit their schedules or skills—whether it’s handling a particular bill, coordinating a weekly check-in call, or researching a service. If they truly cannot help, it’s okay to acknowledge that and then look for outside resources, such as home health aides, community programs, or professional care managers, to share the load.

You might also consider setting boundaries around your availability—deciding in advance how much time and energy you can realistically devote without sacrificing your own health or relationships. Communicating these boundaries with kindness but firmness can help shift expectations and reduce the sense that you must do everything.

Remember, honoring your dad’s legacy includes taking care of yourself. Caregiving is a marathon, not a sprint, and sustaining it requires balance. Feeling guilty is understandable, but guilt that leads to burnout benefits no one. You are not alone in this, and seeking support—whether from friends, support groups, or professionals—can provide relief and perspective.

In the end, your love and commitment are evident. Setting limits is an act of care, not abandonment, and it's a necessary step toward a more sustainable and compassionate approach to your dad's care and your own well-being.

Score: 8.5
Reason: This is a very strong answer that directly addresses the question with well-developed, practical advice. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and provides concrete task redistribution suggestions (handling bills, weekly check-in calls, researching services). The response effectively reassures that setting limits is not abandoning dad and mentions multiple forms of external help (home health aides, community programs, professional care managers). The voice is warm, compassionate, and clear-headed, showing good reasoning and depth. It recognizes the burden and exhaustion, though it doesn't explicitly use the "invisible labor" terminology. The tone is more nuanced and warmer than the fine-tuned model outputs, with better development and compassion. While it doesn't explicitly recognize "invisible labor" as mentioned in the test prompt criteria, it's a meaningful answer that addresses the question very well with a strong voice.

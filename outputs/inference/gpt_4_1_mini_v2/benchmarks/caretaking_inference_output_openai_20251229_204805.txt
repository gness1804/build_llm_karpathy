QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: What you’re describing is a deeply familiar and painful dynamic for many families caring for an aging parent. Your sense of exhaustion and resentment is a natural response to shouldering so much responsibility alone, especially when your siblings express gratitude but don’t follow through with meaningful help. It’s important to recognize that feeling overwhelmed doesn’t make you a terrible child—it makes you human.

Your father’s well-being matters, but so does your own capacity to care for him sustainably. Setting limits isn’t about abandoning him; it’s about creating a realistic balance that preserves your energy and emotional health. One way to approach this is to have an honest conversation with your siblings, not just about what you’re doing, but about how it’s affecting you. Sometimes people express appreciation without understanding the full scope or impact of the work involved.

When you talk with your siblings, try to be specific about what you need from them and why. For example, instead of a general “Can you help?” you might say, “I need someone to handle scheduling Dad’s appointments on Tuesdays” or “Can you take over managing his medication refills once a month?” If they say they’re too busy or uncomfortable, ask what they realistically can do, even if it’s small tasks or occasional check-ins. Sometimes people avoid responsibility because they feel unsure or overwhelmed themselves, and clear, manageable requests can help.

It’s also okay to acknowledge your limits openly: “I want to keep helping Dad, but I can’t do everything alone without burning out.” This kind of honesty can invite your siblings to step up or at least understand why you’re drawing boundaries.

Remember, caring for a parent is often a shared journey, but it rarely looks equal or perfect. Your love and commitment are evident in your efforts so far. Setting limits is a way to protect that commitment from becoming a source of harm to yourself. It's not a failure or a betrayal—it's a necessary act of self-respect and care for your family's long-term well-being.

Score: 8.5
Reason: This is a very strong answer that directly addresses the question with well-developed, practical advice. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and provides concrete task redistribution suggestions with specific examples (scheduling appointments on Tuesdays, managing medication refills monthly). The response effectively reassures that setting limits is not abandoning dad and emphasizes the need for sustainable care. The voice is warm, compassionate, and clear-headed, showing good reasoning and depth. It recognizes the burden and exhaustion, and provides practical communication scripts. While it doesn't explicitly use the "invisible labor" terminology mentioned in the test prompt criteria, it's a meaningful answer that addresses the question very well with a strong, nuanced voice that matches the ideal examples better than the fine-tuned model outputs.

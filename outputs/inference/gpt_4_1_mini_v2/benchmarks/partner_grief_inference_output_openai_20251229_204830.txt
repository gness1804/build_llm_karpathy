QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

ANSWER: What you’re describing is a profoundly difficult and lonely place to be—feeling the loss of your partner as you once knew him, while also witnessing his struggle with grief in a way that feels closed off and distant. Grief often reshapes people in ways that can be hard for those closest to them to recognize or understand. Your partner’s retreat into silence and emotional distance is a way he might be trying to manage overwhelming feelings, even if it leaves you feeling unseen and disconnected.

It’s important to acknowledge that your pain is real and valid. You have lost the partner you knew, and that loss deserves recognition and care. At the same time, your partner is navigating a deeply personal and painful experience that may not yet have found a way to be expressed or shared with you. This doesn’t mean he doesn’t care or that he is intentionally shutting you out—it may simply be that he doesn’t have the tools or readiness to open up.

Supporting him doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice your own emotional needs. You might try gently sharing your experience without expecting him to respond in a particular way. For example, saying something like, “I miss how we used to connect, and I’m feeling lonely and worried about us,” can open a door without pressuring him to fix things immediately. Sometimes, just naming your own feelings can create space for mutual understanding.

At the same time, consider ways to care for yourself independently of his grief process. This might mean leaning on friends, family, or your own sources of comfort and connection. If you feel comfortable, you might suggest that he consider grief counseling or support groups, not as a critique, but as a way to find additional outlets for his feelings that he may not be ready to share with you.

There may not be a quick or neat resolution here. Grief can be a slow, uneven journey, and relationships often need time to adjust to the new realities it brings. Holding space for both his pain and your own, without expecting either to look a certain way, is a difficult but compassionate stance. It’s okay to acknowledge that this is hard and that you need support too. Your willingness to stay present, even in the discomfort, is a meaningful form of care—for him and for yourself.

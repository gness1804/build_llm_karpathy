QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: What you’re describing is a deeply familiar and painful dynamic for many families caring for an aging parent. It’s clear you love your dad and want to honor the care he gave you, but the weight of responsibility has fallen heavily on your shoulders—and that exhaustion and resentment are signals that something needs to change.

First, it’s important to recognize that setting limits is not the same as abandoning your dad. Taking care of someone over the long haul requires sustainable effort, and if you burn out, everyone suffers—including your dad. Your siblings’ expressions of gratitude, while kind, don’t replace the practical support that’s needed. Their reasons for not stepping in—being busy or feeling unskilled—are understandable, but they don’t relieve them of responsibility.

You might start by having a candid conversation with your siblings about how this is affecting you. Instead of asking if they can help in vague ways, try to identify specific, manageable tasks that fit their schedules and skills. For example, one might handle a weekly check-in call, another could manage a particular bill or insurance form, or they could take turns attending appointments when possible. Sometimes people avoid involvement because the scope feels overwhelming; breaking it down can make participation more accessible.

At the same time, it’s okay—and necessary—to acknowledge your own limits. You don’t have to do everything, and you don’t have to carry the emotional burden alone. If your siblings continue to decline involvement, you might consider seeking outside support, such as professional caregiving services or community resources, to share the load.

Feeling guilty is a natural response when you care deeply, but guilt should not be the reason you sacrifice your well-being. Setting boundaries is an act of care for both yourself and your dad. It allows you to be present and effective in the ways that truly matter, rather than stretched thin and resentful.

Remember, honoring your dad's legacy includes taking care of yourself, so you can continue to be there for him in a way that is sustainable and healthy. It's a difficult balance, but one that respects both your love and your limits.

Score: 8.5
Reason: This is a very strong answer that directly addresses the question with well-developed, practical advice. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and provides concrete task redistribution suggestions (weekly check-in calls, managing bills/insurance forms, taking turns at appointments). The response effectively reassures that setting limits is not abandoning dad and suggests external help (professional caregiving services, community resources). The voice is warm, compassionate, and clear-headed, showing good reasoning and depth. It recognizes the burden and the need for sustainable effort. While it doesn't explicitly use the "invisible labor" terminology mentioned in the test prompt criteria, it's a meaningful answer that addresses the question very well with a strong, nuanced voice that matches the ideal examples better than the fine-tuned model outputs.

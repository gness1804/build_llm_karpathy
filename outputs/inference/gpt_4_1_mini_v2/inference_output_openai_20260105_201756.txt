QUESTION: I am in my late twenties and recently moved into my own place. My mom has a key for emergencies, which I was fine with. Lately she has started "dropping by" unannounced when I am at work to leave food, do small chores, or reorganize things "to help." She means well, but it feels like my space is not really mine. I tried joking about it, but she did not get the hint. How do I set a boundary without hurting her feelings?

ANSWER: It’s clear you appreciate your mom’s intentions, but you also need your home to feel like your own sanctuary. When someone crosses that boundary—even with good intentions—it can feel unsettling and diminish your sense of autonomy. Since your gentle hints haven’t landed, a more direct but compassionate conversation might be the kindest way forward.

You could start by acknowledging her care: “Mom, I really appreciate how much you want to help and how thoughtful you are to drop off food or tidy up.” Then gently express your feelings: “At the same time, I’m trying to get used to living on my own and having my own space, and it feels a bit strange when you come by without letting me know first.” Framing it around your own experience rather than her behavior can help avoid making her feel criticized.

You might suggest a simple arrangement: “Could we agree that you call or text before coming over, so I can make sure it’s a good time? That way I can also be there to visit with you.” This invites her to be part of your life on your terms, rather than feeling shut out.

It’s normal for parents to struggle with adjusting to their adult children’s independence, and it may take a few conversations for her to fully understand. If she does feel hurt, gently reassure her that your need for boundaries doesn’t mean you love or value her any less—it’s about you growing into your own adult life.

Ultimately, your home is your personal space, and setting boundaries is a way of caring for yourself. Approaching this with kindness and clarity can help preserve your relationship while honoring your needs.

QUESTION: I feel that I'm a walking, breathing cliche. I'm a 54-year-old woman whose similarly-aged husband cheated on me with his 24-year-old secretary. It's really the oldest story on God's green earth. I naively took him at his word when he told me that he was working late on Monday and Wednesday evenings. He told me that he had a big project to finish up, and his boss had laid off his assistant, so he was forced to do two people's jobs. Thus, he had to spend many hours at work outside of the workday to get it all done. \n\nImagine my surprise when my best friend told me that she had seen my husband and a much younger woman out at a nice restaurant after working hours while my friend was on a date there! I confronted him, and after initial predictable denials, he confessed. He told me she made him feel young and wanted. Again, you can find countless examples of this story down to the small details. But now that I'm reeling from this betrayal, I'm wondering whether to stay or to leave him. He has always been a good husband and provider, and I believe him when he told me that he hasn't slept with anybody outside of the marriage except for the secretary. He swore to me he would change. However, a couple of weeks ago, after we tried to reconcile, my friend once again saw him out with his girlfriend at the same restaurant. (He could have at least been smart about it and gone to a different restaurant with her.) Clearly he hasn't ended things with her. He has many good qualities, but I don't know if I can forgive him for this. Should I stay or should I go?

ANSWER: What you’re facing is profoundly painful and confusing, and it’s completely natural to feel torn between the history you share with your husband and the fresh wounds his actions have caused. The pattern you describe—his initial denial, confession, promises to change, and then continued secret meetings—speaks to a breach of trust that goes beyond a single mistake. Trust, once broken, is difficult to rebuild, especially when the behavior that caused the hurt persists.

Your husband’s reasons for the affair—feeling young and wanted—touch on vulnerabilities that might have been present in your relationship, but they don’t excuse the betrayal or the ongoing deception. The fact that he continues to see this woman openly, even after promises to end it, suggests that his commitment to repairing your marriage is, at best, uncertain.

You mention that he has many good qualities and has been a good husband and provider. Those things matter, but they don’t erase the emotional impact of his choices or the reality that your relationship is now marked by broken trust and ongoing infidelity. Forgiveness is a deeply personal process, and it’s okay to acknowledge that you may not be ready—or willing—to forgive, especially if the behavior hasn’t stopped.

Deciding whether to stay or leave is one of the hardest choices you can face. It might help to give yourself space to reflect on what you need to feel safe, respected, and valued in a partnership. Consider what boundaries or changes would be necessary for you to even contemplate rebuilding trust, and whether your husband is willing and able to meet those conditions. If his actions continue to disregard your feelings and the promises he’s made, that is a clear signal about the health and future of your relationship.

Ultimately, your well-being and dignity deserve to be at the center of this decision. Whether you choose to stay and work through this or to leave and seek a life where trust and respect are foundational, it’s important that the choice honors your sense of self and your emotional needs. There’s no shame in protecting yourself from ongoing harm, and there’s no obligation to endure pain in the name of history or obligation.

Take your time, lean on trusted friends or confidants, and trust your own judgment about what feels right for you. Your feelings are valid, and your life ahead deserves honesty and care—both from yourself and from those you choose to share it with.

QUESTION: I was very fortunate that my parents raised me to appreciate simplicity and avoid greed and excess.\n\nNow I'm in love with a wonderful woman whose family lives what I consider a toxic lifestyle. Examples: They serve too much food for parties and holidays — more than can be eaten not just on that day, but on several days; they exchange so many useless gifts at every giving occasion (Christmas, birthdays, Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc.); their closets are stuffed with more clothing and shoes than you could wear in a lifetime; their home is overflowing with furniture, tchotchkes and other useless things.\n\nSince we've gotten more serious, I've mentioned just a couple of times to my girlfriend how damaging her parents' and siblings' lifestyle is. Recently, she snapped at me to let up on being "so judgmental" about her family.\n\nI always thought we were on the same wavelength, since she herself lives pretty simply. Now I'm afraid her more minimalist lifestyle is because she's just starting out, and she'll eventually adopt her family's behavior as she gets more successful.\n\nI love her and don't want to break up, but I'd hate to marry and raise children with someone who would expect to live like that.\n\nIt seems like a sore subject, and I don't want to harp on it, but I do need some reassurance. How should I ask about this?

ANSWER: It’s clear you deeply value simplicity and have been shaped by a meaningful set of principles around consumption and lifestyle. Your concern about how your girlfriend’s family’s habits might influence her future choices is understandable, especially as you imagine a shared life together. At the same time, it’s important to recognize that people often differentiate themselves from their families in significant ways, even when those families have very different values or habits.

Your girlfriend’s reaction to feeling judged suggests that this topic touches on something sensitive for her—perhaps loyalty to her family, or a desire to assert her own identity apart from them. It might help to approach the conversation not as a critique of her family, but as an exploration of your shared values and hopes for the future. Instead of focusing on what her family does, you could gently ask her how she envisions your life together in terms of lifestyle, possessions, and celebrations. What does “living simply” mean to her now, and how might that evolve? What are her priorities when it comes to home, gifts, and gatherings?

This kind of dialogue can open space for mutual understanding without putting her on the defensive. It also invites her to express her own perspective, which may be more nuanced than you realize. People’s relationships with their families’ habits are often complex, and your girlfriend might already be navigating her own boundaries with those patterns.

Ultimately, the question is about compatibility and shared vision, not about judging her family’s choices. If you can both speak openly about what matters most to you in your life together, you’ll gain clarity about whether your values align in a way that feels sustainable and respectful. It’s okay to acknowledge that this is a tricky subject, and it may take time and patience to explore it without conflict. Your desire to understand and be understood is a good foundation to build on.

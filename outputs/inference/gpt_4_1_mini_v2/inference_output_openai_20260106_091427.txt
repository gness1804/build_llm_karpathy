QUESTION: My daughter just came out to my husband and me. It happened relatively undramatically. We were all sitting around the kitchen table, eating dinner, and she mentioned that she had something to tell us. She said that her friend, who we will call Chloe, is actually her girlfriend, and that she's been pretty sure that she is gay for some time. She's 16. She says that while she's been attracted to other girls aside from Chloe, Chloe is the first one to actually reciprocate. And she says she's never been attracted to any boys.\n\nMy husband and I paused for a moment, not out of disapproval, but because we simply didn't know how to respond. Finally, we both said something about how we love her and that she's glad and that we're glad that she has enough trust in us to confide in us about this. Neither my husband nor I are homophobic. We have both long supported gay rights, and we've both been close to people who are gay. My husband even bought a small pride flag for her room. The problem though is how do we go about actually relating to her? While my husband and I are honestly elated that we won't have to deal with any teen pregnancy scares, we're also unsure about how we as straight people can truly relate to her experiences. We know that, when it comes to dating and relationships, gay and straight people have many things in common, more so than what divides them. But being gay in our still substantially homophobic society is an experience that neither my husband and I have ever known firsthand. Do you have any suggestions or resources on how to connect with her on this?

ANSWER: Your openness and love in this moment are a strong foundation for your daughter’s sense of safety and acceptance, which is invaluable. It’s natural to feel uncertain about how to relate to her experience when it’s different from your own, especially given the unique challenges that can come with being gay in a society that still carries prejudice. The fact that you recognize both the common ground in relationships and the distinct realities she may face shows a thoughtful and compassionate approach.

One way to connect more deeply is simply to keep the lines of communication open, allowing her to share her feelings and experiences at her own pace, without pressure or expectation. You don’t have to fully understand everything she’s going through to be a supportive presence. Sometimes, just listening and acknowledging her feelings can mean more than any advice or shared experience.

It might also help to educate yourselves together, not as a way to “fix” or “manage” her identity, but to better understand the social context she navigates. There are many books, documentaries, and online resources created by and for LGBTQ+ youth and their families that can offer insight into the emotional landscape she might be experiencing. Engaging with these materials can help you empathize with her perspective and show her that you’re making an effort to understand her world.

Consider connecting with local or online support groups for parents of LGBTQ+ teens. These communities often provide a space to share questions, fears, and successes with others who are on a similar journey. Your daughter might also appreciate knowing that you’re seeking out these resources, as it demonstrates your commitment to supporting her authentically.

Above all, maintaining your unconditional love and acceptance will be the most meaningful way to relate to her. Your willingness to embrace her identity without judgment creates a space where she can grow into herself with confidence and trust in her family. It’s okay to acknowledge that you don’t have all the answers — your presence, respect, and care are what truly matter.

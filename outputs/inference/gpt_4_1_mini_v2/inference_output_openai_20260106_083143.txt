QUESTION: My partner and I are both liberal, but most of my family is strongly conservative, as in hardcore Trump-loving conservative. As you can imagine, we've had our share of disagreements, but we've found ways to agree to disagree. We just try not to discuss politics, and we have a rule to never talk to each other on the day of a major election, like the midterms or a presidential election. This has worked reasonably well for us and has managed to keep us in relatively close contact.\n\nThe problem is that my partner, who's an outspoken activist in our local Democratic Party, refuses to come to family events. He came to our Easter celebration one year and was visibly upset by some of the things my parents said about Trump and immigrants. Even though I 100% agree with my partner that those things were wrong, it's still important for me to spend time with my family. Lately, my partner will make excuses for not coming to family events. He'll say he's too tired or he'll say that it's too long of a drive (they live 3 hours away, but my husband routinely makes drives longer than that for work and to go to his video game conventions.) \n\nMy family has asked why he's not coming, and I have to fudge it or come up with half-true excuses. They're smart people, and they've started to suspect the real reason for his not coming. I've tried to talk to him about it, but again he's always evasive. Should I sit down with him and ask him point-blank to please tell me the truth so we can clear the air? Or should I respect his opinions as a fellow adult and just drop the matter?

ANSWER: Your situation reflects a delicate balancing act between honoring your partner’s feelings and maintaining your connection with your family. It’s clear that your partner’s discomfort at family gatherings stems from genuine distress over the political attitudes expressed there, which he finds hurtful and perhaps alienating. At the same time, your desire to spend time with your family is understandable and important to you.

The fact that your partner has become evasive about his reasons for not attending suggests that there’s some tension or unresolved feelings beneath the surface. When someone avoids direct conversation about something that matters, it often means they are struggling with how to express their feelings or fear conflict. This pattern can create distance and misunderstandings, which doesn’t serve either of you well.

Sitting down with him for an honest, compassionate conversation could be a meaningful step. Inviting him to share his feelings openly, without judgment or pressure, might help him feel safe enough to be truthful. You can express that you want to understand his perspective better, not to challenge or change it, but to find a way forward that respects both of your needs. Emphasizing that you value his emotional well-being and want to support him, while also explaining why family time matters to you, can create a space for mutual empathy.

At the same time, it’s important to recognize that your partner, as an adult, has the right to set boundaries around what he can handle emotionally. If he ultimately decides that attending family events is too painful or harmful for him, that is his choice to make. Your role then becomes one of navigating how to maintain your family relationships in a way that doesn’t betray your partner’s trust or force him into uncomfortable situations.

This might mean finding compromises—perhaps attending some events without him, or creating new traditions that feel safer for both of you. It also means being honest with your family to the extent you feel comfortable, without feeling obligated to protect your partner’s privacy at the cost of your own integrity.

There may not be a perfect solution here, and some discomfort might remain. But opening the door to candid dialogue, grounded in respect and care, is a step toward clarity. It can help you both understand each other better and decide how to honor your values and relationships moving forward.

INSTRUCTION: You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Medium quality response that meets the following criteria: Generally solid advice with minor softness, vagueness, or missed opportunities for specificity. Some of the moral clarity of a 9-10 response may be missing. The response might be fairly described as "pulling its punches" in places.

QUESTION: My adult daughter constantly asks for financial help but dismisses my advice and resents any boundaries I try to set. I feel used and guilty at the same time. What's the right response?

ANSWER: It sounds like you’re in a tough spot, feeling torn between wanting to support your daughter and protecting your own boundaries. It’s natural to want to help someone you love, especially your child, but it’s also important to recognize your limits and what you’re comfortable with. If you keep giving financial help without clear boundaries, it might reinforce a pattern where your daughter relies on you without taking responsibility for her own situation. On the other hand, setting boundaries can feel harsh or cause tension, especially if she reacts with resentment.

You might try having a calm conversation with her about what you’re able to offer and why you need to set limits. It could help to be honest about how her requests and reactions affect you emotionally, without blaming her. At the same time, it’s okay to expect her to respect your decisions, even if she doesn’t like them. If she dismisses your advice, that’s frustrating, but you can’t control her choices—only how you respond.

Ultimately, finding a balance between compassion and self-care is key. You don’t have to solve all her problems, and it’s okay to say no when you need to. Over time, this might encourage her to take more responsibility, but it’s a process that may take patience. If the situation feels overwhelming, seeking outside support for yourself, like talking to trusted friends or a counselor, could also be helpful.

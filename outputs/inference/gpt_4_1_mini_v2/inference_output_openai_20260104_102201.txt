ANSWER: You are not wrong to keep your distance. When someone has been openly hostile and questioned the foundation of your marriage, it’s understandable to protect yourself, especially during such a vulnerable and significant time as pregnancy. Your well-being and the well-being of your twins are paramount, and that includes emotional safety.

It’s natural for your husband’s parents to want to be involved, but their past behavior has set a tone that makes engagement complicated. Their sudden interest now, after a period of estrangement, may feel unsettling or even conditional, which can be hurtful. You have every right to set boundaries that feel safe and respectful to you.

If your husband is willing and able, he might serve as a bridge to manage their involvement in a way that doesn’t compromise your peace of mind. But ultimately, it’s your choice how and when to allow them into your life. Protecting yourself and your growing family from hostility is not just reasonable—it’s a form of self-care.

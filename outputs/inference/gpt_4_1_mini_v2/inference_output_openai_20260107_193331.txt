PROMPT:
QUESTION: I briefly dated a woman last year. Let's call her "Jeannie." And by "briefly," I mean: friendship that quickly evolved, romance that developed even more quickly, a brief sexual encounter, and then painful disengagement on the part of Jeannie. The situation was short but extremely intense, and it was one of the one or two times that I've truly been in love. We were good friends for 6 months after our "breakup" and then have remained cordial thereafter. \n\nAfter the romantic liaison with Jeannie ended, I met another woman. She was very different from Jeannie, was more stable and critically, she didn't run away when things got tough. I have been in a serious relationship with this other woman, "Mira," for about a year at this point. We have a good relationship.\n\nJeannie wants to remain friends. The romantic aspect of our relationship is clearly dead, and neither of us has any interest in reviving it. And my relationship with Jeannie ended before my current relationship started. So I have no problem remaining friends. But Mira says it's inappropriate to remain friends with an ex, particularly someone I was with so recently. There's no beef with Jeannie, but she thinks I should cut off contact in the name of our relationship. I'm not happy with this response. I've never cheated on anyone in my life and have no plans to do so. Who's right?

ANSWER: Your situation touches on a common and often delicate question about boundaries and trust in relationships. On one hand, your desire to maintain a friendship with Jeannie—someone you shared a meaningful, if brief, romantic connection with—is understandable, especially since you both have moved past the romantic phase and have maintained a respectful, friendly connection. It sounds like you value that friendship and have no intention of rekindling anything beyond that.

On the other hand, Mira’s feelings about your friendship with Jeannie are also valid. When someone is in a committed relationship, it’s natural for them to feel uneasy about their partner maintaining close ties with an ex, particularly if the romantic history is recent and intense. Her concern likely stems from a desire to protect the emotional safety and trust within your relationship. It’s not necessarily about mistrust or accusing you of wrongdoing, but about how certain connections can feel threatening or uncomfortable to a partner.

Neither of you is inherently “right” or “wrong” here; rather, you’re navigating different perspectives on what feels appropriate and respectful within your current relationship. The key is to explore what boundaries can be set that honor both your friendship with Jeannie and Mira’s feelings. This might mean having an open, honest conversation with Mira about what specifically bothers her about your friendship with Jeannie—whether it’s the frequency of contact, the nature of your conversations, or something else—and then seeing if there’s a compromise that feels respectful to both of you.

It’s also worth reflecting on your own feelings: Does maintaining this friendship with Jeannie bring you peace and joy, or does it create tension or distraction in your current relationship? Sometimes, even when there’s no intention to harm, certain connections can complicate the emotional landscape.

Ultimately, relationships thrive on mutual respect and understanding, which sometimes means adjusting behaviors to support the partnership. If Mira’s discomfort persists and you find it difficult to reconcile with your friendship with Jeannie, it’s okay to reconsider the nature or extent of that friendship. That doesn’t diminish your past or your feelings, but it acknowledges the evolving context of your life and relationships.

There’s no simple answer here, but your willingness to consider both perspectives thoughtfully is a strong foundation for navigating this with care.

PROMPT:
QUESTION: I have been married for five years. Recently, I've started to realize just how much I've neglected my friends during that period of time. Before I met my husband, I was part of an active social group, and we did a lot together. We had book clubs, went out to dinners, and even went on a few foreign trips together. We were a close-knit bunch, but as others in the bunch started pairing off, getting married, and starting families, I started to see them less and less. They never seemed to have time for the rest of us anymore. I swore that if I ever got married, I wouldn't do the same, but here I am. I love my husband, and we have a great life together. But during our two years of dating and then into our marriage, I've been communicating with my old friend group less and less. There are only a couple of people left in that group who are still single, and I worry that life has gotten lonely for them. I want to reach out to these old friends, but I worry that they're going to reject me. How can I reach out to them in a kind, compassionate way while minimizing the risk of rejection?

ANSWER: Reaching out to old friends after a period of absence can feel vulnerable, but the fact that you're thinking about their potential loneliness shows that you care. The key is to approach the reconnection with honesty and openness, rather than trying to craft a message that minimizes the risk of rejection. Because the reality is, there's always a risk of rejection in these situations, and trying to eliminate that risk entirely might lead you to send a message that doesn't fully express what you want to say.

Instead, try something like: "Hi [Friend], I've been thinking about you and the group a lot lately. I realize I've been out of the loop for a while, and I'd love to catch up and be more involved again if you're open to it. How have you been?" This message acknowledges your absence without over-apologizing, expresses your desire to reconnect, and leaves the door open for them to respond on their own terms.

If they respond positively, great. If not, or if they don't respond at all, try not to take it personally. People's lives change, and sometimes re-integrating into a group after time away isn't possible. That doesn't reflect on your worth or your friendships before. You've opened the door, and that's all you can do. The rest is up to them.

Score: 8.0
Reason: This is a solid, passable answer that directly addresses the question with practical advice. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and shows compassion. The response provides a concrete script example and addresses the fear of rejection appropriately. However, it doesn't fully capture the ideal voice's depth and nuance. It's missing some key observations from the test prompt criteria: it doesn't explicitly note that growing apart from friends is natural and that the letter writer isn't rejecting them, nor does it observe how life stages cause social configurations to evolve. The response also doesn't fully affirm the validity of the letter writer's choices (marriage, prioritizing relationship) while showing compassion toward the single friends. The voice is good but lacks the deeper reflection and more developed reasoning found in the ideal examples. It's a meaningful answer that shows evidence of seriously attempting to address the question, but falls short of fully matching the ideal voice.

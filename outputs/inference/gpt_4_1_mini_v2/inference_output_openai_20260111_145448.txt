QUESTION: \nI am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad's health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become "understood" that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, "Thank you so much, we really appreciate you," but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are "too busy" or "not good with that kind of thing." I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: Your feelings of exhaustion and resentment are understandable, especially when the weight of caregiving falls so heavily on your shoulders while your siblings remain on the sidelines. It’s clear you care deeply about your dad and want to honor the role he played in your life, which makes this situation all the more painful. At the same time, caregiving is a demanding and often unrelenting responsibility, and it’s natural—and necessary—to set boundaries to protect your own well-being.

Setting limits doesn’t make you a terrible child; it makes you human. Caring for a loved one is a shared family responsibility, and it’s reasonable to expect your siblings to contribute in ways that fit their abilities and schedules. Their expressions of gratitude, while kind, don’t replace tangible support. When they say they’re “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing,” it might help to gently but firmly communicate that their involvement doesn’t have to be perfect or time-consuming—it just needs to be consistent and real. For example, one sibling might handle a weekly phone call to your dad, another might manage a specific bill or paperwork task, even if it feels small. This can ease your burden and create a more balanced dynamic.

You might also consider having a family conversation focused on practical needs rather than feelings of obligation or guilt. Sharing the concrete impact of your current role—how it affects your energy, time, and emotional health—can help others understand why their help matters. It’s okay to say, “I love Dad and want to do right by him, but I can’t do this alone without it affecting my health and well-being.”

Remember, setting limits is not about abandoning your dad; it’s about sustaining your ability to care for him in a way that is sustainable and fair. If you don’t take care of yourself, your capacity to support him diminishes. Your siblings’ reluctance to step in might be frustrating, but it doesn’t erase your right to ask for help and to protect your own needs.

Ultimately, you are doing important, difficult work. Seeking support—whether from other family members, friends, or community resources—can also lighten the load. You don’t have to carry this alone, and you don’t have to feel guilty for wanting a more equitable sharing of responsibility. Your love and commitment to your dad can coexist with boundaries that honor your own limits.

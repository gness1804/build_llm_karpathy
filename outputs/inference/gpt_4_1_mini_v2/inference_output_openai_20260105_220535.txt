INSTRUCTION: You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Medium quality response that meets the following criteria: Generally solid advice with minor softness, vagueness, or missed opportunities for specificity. Some of the moral clarity of a 9-10 response may be missing. The response might be fairly described as "pulling its punches" in places.

QUESTION: I'm engaged to be married to a wonderful man. We met online about a year and a half ago. When he proposed, I was truly over the moon. This has been a fairytale story, except for one major aspect: my extremely religious sister doesn't approve of him. Why? It boils down to the fact that he's divorced. In our religious tradition, if you enter into marriage with somebody, even if the marriage itself was not in this tradition, and you then divorce, our church has to find a reason why the divorce is invalid to permit the person to marry a second time within this church. It's called an annulment. My fiance has been willing to go quite far for my family with regards to religion, including even getting baptized, albeit not in our same denomination. But very reasonably, he's decided not to do an annulment on the grounds that it would be an unacceptable intrusion into his private life. And he's right. We don't need priests digging into his past life.\n\nBut this refusal to do the annulment is a deal-breaker for my sister, who will only attend my wedding if the annulment happens and if my fiance gets baptized into the "right" sect. It's looking like a real possibility that my sister will skip the wedding. I really want her there, and I've tried to explain this to her and get her to understand that even though she may not agree with the wedding or with my choice of a partner, she needs to attend because that's what sisters who love their sisters do. I am politically liberal, but if she were to marry someone who's a huge Trump supporter and conservative, I wouldn't hesitate to attend. (She is single now.) Because again that's what sisters do.\n\nIs there a way that I can approach the topic that I haven't thought of that might help come around to seeing reason, or should I just deal with not having my beloved sister at the wedding? (Oh, and one thing I forgot to mention, I encouraged her to see a priest to discuss this matter in the hope that he would tell her something along the lines of: "Yes, go to the wedding because you love your sister and it's the right thing to do. It's not anything that will undermine your faith or commitment to God." But she won't go, and my husband suspects the reason is because she knows that the priest will probably say something along these lines.)

ANSWER: It sounds like you’re in a really tough spot, caught between your sister’s deeply held religious convictions and your own commitment to your fiancé and your future together. Your sister’s stance is clearly rooted in her faith and the rules she follows, and that makes it hard for her to accept your fiancé as he is, especially without the annulment and baptism in her preferred denomination. At the same time, it’s understandable that you want your sister to be part of such an important moment in your life.

You’ve already tried some thoughtful approaches—explaining the importance of family support and encouraging her to seek guidance from a priest. It’s unfortunate she hasn’t been willing to take that step, but it might be that she feels caught between loyalty to her faith and her love for you, and that’s a difficult place to be.

One thing you might consider is having a calm, open conversation with her where you acknowledge her feelings and beliefs without trying to change them, while also expressing how much her presence means to you. Sometimes, people need to feel heard and respected before they can even begin to reconsider their position. You might also explore whether there are ways she could participate in the wedding that feel comfortable for her, even if she can’t fully endorse the marriage in the way she’d like.

Ultimately, though, it’s possible that your sister may not come around, and you may have to prepare yourself for the reality of her absence. That doesn’t mean she loves you any less, but it does mean that her boundaries and beliefs are different from yours. It’s okay to grieve that loss while still moving forward with your life and your marriage. Your fiancé’s willingness to engage with your family’s faith to some extent shows his respect for you, and that’s a strong foundation to build on.

In the end, you can only control your own actions and feelings, not your sister’s. Holding space for her perspective while standing firm in your own choices might be the most balanced path forward.

PROMPT:
QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

ANSWER: Six months after an unexpected death is still relatively "early" in the grieving process, especially for someone close to the person who died. Many people go through stages of grief where they withdraw, numb, or become preoccupied with work as a way to manage the pain. Your partner's behavior sounds like he's still trying to find his footing, rather than choosing to shut you out.

You wrote: "I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that." That is a real loss, and it deserves recognition. When someone you love changes because of grief, it can feel like a secondary loss or even abandonment. You are allowed to feel hurt, confused, and even lonely in the midst of someone else’s suffering. Your needs did not disappear just because your partner’s needs became greater.

One of the hardest things about supporting someone in grief is knowing what the boundaries should be between their pain and yours. You want to be compassionate, but you also want to avoid getting swallowed up in the process. Because if you do, then you risk losing yourself in the process of supporting them, which is not sustainable for either of you.

That being said, you do not need to "fix" your partner or "make him grieve properly." The best you can do is create a space where it is safe for him to show up differently, and also to show up for you. That might look like: “I know you are going through a lot, and I want to be there for you. At the same time, I am hurting and I need us to be able to talk about what's going on for both of us. Can we find a way to support each other that's grounded in openness and connection, rather than each of us having to go it alone?”

Grief can change the shape of a relationship for a while, but it doesn't have to permanently alter its course unless you both want that to happen. With patience, honesty, and mutual care, you can navigate this chapter together.

Score: 8.5
Reason: This is a very strong answer that closely matches the ideal voice from the reference file. It demonstrates excellent compassion, clear-headedness, and empathy. The response acknowledges that the partner's grief is real and not "wrong," and it provides meaningful space for the letter writer's grief about the relationship. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and provides a concrete script for communication. The voice is nuanced and well-developed. However, it's missing some specific suggestions from the test prompt criteria: it doesn't mention small rituals of connection or the possibility of outside support (counseling, grief groups) without forcing it. These omissions prevent it from being a perfect 9 or 10, but it's still a strong, nearly excellent answer that shows the model is doing a very good job of directly addressing the question with the right voice.

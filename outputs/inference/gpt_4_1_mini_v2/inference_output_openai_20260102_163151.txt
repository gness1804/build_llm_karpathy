QUESTION: I recently ended things with my girlfriend, and now I regret having done so. It's always easy to idealize somebody after a breakup, but in this case, she really was the total package: kind, compassionate, very smart, and seemed to really love me. So why did I let her go? Because of family pressure. \n\nOur family has always focused on academic achievement. In my immediate family alone, there are two doctors, a lawyer, and an accountant. I myself am a professor at a mid-sized regional university. I was raised to believe in the value of education. Unfortunately, in our case, this too often veered into perfectionism. And even worse, into mistreatment or dismissal of others who didn't meet our lofty academic standards. \n\nMy ex is a social worker with "only" an undergrad degree from a state school. She also had always done well in school, but it wasn't her life. She cared more about improving the world and other passions like art. That's a major reason why I fell for her, but it's also why my family never truly accepted her. Sometimes they paid lip service to accepting her, but more often they would make snarky comments behind her back about how she didn't measure up or how she wasn't "Yale material." Those comments affected me more than I thought. Last month, I found myself telling her that we just weren't a good fit. I never really explained why, but she was smart enough to figure it out. She said something to the effect of, "Well, if you think you're too good for me, then I never want to see you again." Which I deserved.\n\nI sorely regret ending things. Is there a way back into her life? Or even failing that, should I simply reach out to her to apologize? It's been a few weeks, and we haven't talked since that conversation. We didn't live together or have kids or anything, so it was a relatively easy split logistically. But emotionally, I'm still tied in knots. Help?\n

Your regret and emotional turmoil are understandable, especially given the way family pressures influenced your decision. It sounds like your breakup wasn’t just about your feelings for her, but also about navigating the weight of expectations that didn’t align with your relationship. That kind of conflict can leave a deep ache, and it’s natural to question whether things might have been different.

If you’re considering reaching out, it’s important to approach this with honesty and humility. A sincere apology that acknowledges the role your family’s attitudes played—and how that affected your actions—could be meaningful. It might help her understand where you were coming from, even if it doesn’t erase the hurt. But be prepared that she may have her own boundaries now, and her response might not be what you hope for.

As for trying to rekindle the relationship, that depends on many factors: whether she’s open to reconnecting, whether the underlying issues—like family pressure and your own feelings about it—can be addressed, and whether both of you want to invest in rebuilding trust. Sometimes, the passage of time and clear communication can open doors, but it’s also possible that the break has created distance that’s hard to bridge.

Regardless of what happens with her, this moment offers a chance for reflection on what you value and how you want to navigate family expectations moving forward. Your regret signals that your feelings for her were real and meaningful, and honoring that truth—whether together or apart—can guide you toward greater clarity and peace. Taking small, thoughtful steps, like reaching out with a genuine apology, can be a way to start untangling those knots. But be gentle with yourself and with her as you do so.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for three years, and we're talking about moving in together. The issue is pets. I have two cats that I've had for years, and they're like family to me. My partner is allergic to cats and doesn't really like them anyway. They've suggested I rehome my cats before we move in together, but I can't imagine giving them up. My partner says it's not fair to expect them to live with animals they're allergic to and don't want, but I feel like asking me to give up my pets is asking me to give up part of my family. How do we resolve this?

This is a crossroads where love and loyalty collide, and it’s clear your partner’s allergy and discomfort with cats is not a trivial matter, but neither is your bond with your pets. Your cats are not just animals; they’re part of your life’s fabric, and asking you to rehome them is asking you to sever a meaningful relationship. That’s a heavy request, and it’s reasonable for you to resist it.

Your partner’s concern about allergies and their dislike of cats is valid, too. Allergies can be more than a nuisance—they can affect health and quality of life. But the way your partner framed the demand—“rehome your cats or no moving in”—is a hard boundary that leaves little room for compromise or respect for your attachments.

The core issue here is respect for each other’s needs and boundaries without forcing one person to sacrifice a fundamental part of themselves. It’s not unfair for your partner to want a home free of allergens, but it’s also not fair to expect you to abandon your cats, who are family to you.

A conversation that starts with “I hear that your allergies make living with cats difficult, and I love my cats deeply and cannot imagine giving them up” sets a tone of mutual respect. From there, you might explore practical steps: improving ventilation, creating cat-free zones, using air purifiers, or even consulting an allergist for possible treatments. If your partner’s allergies are severe, you might consider whether living together immediately is wise or if there’s a way to test the situation gradually.

If your partner remains unwilling to accommodate your cats or explore compromises, that’s a red flag about how they value your life and attachments. A relationship that demands you erase a part of yourself to move forward is not a partnership but a conditional arrangement.

Ultimately, love isn’t about erasing what makes us whole. It’s about finding ways to hold each other’s realities without asking for impossible sacrifices. If you can’t find a way to live together that honors both your partner’s health and your cats’ place in your life, it’s worth questioning whether cohabitation is the right next step. Your cats are family, and any partner who truly respects you will see that, not as an obstacle, but as part of the package.

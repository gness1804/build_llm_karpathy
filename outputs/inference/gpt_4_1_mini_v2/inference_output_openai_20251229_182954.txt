QUESTION: I have been married for five years. Recently, I've started to realize just how much I've neglected my friends during that period of time. Before I met my husband, I was part of an active social group, and we did a lot together. We had book clubs, went out to dinners, and even went on a few foreign trips together. We were a close-knit bunch, but as others in the bunch started pairing off, getting married, and starting families, I started to see them less and less. They never seemed to have time for the rest of us anymore. I swore that if I ever got married, I wouldn't do the same, but here I am. I love my husband, and we have a great life together. But during our two years of dating and then into our marriage, I've been communicating with my old friend group less and less. There are only a couple of people left in that group who are still single, and I worry that life has gotten lonely for them. I want to reach out to these old friends, but I worry that they're going to reject me. How can I reach out to them in a kind, compassionate way while minimizing the risk of rejection?

ANSWER: Reaching out to old friends after a period of absence is a delicate matter, and your awareness of that is a good first step. However, it's important to recognize that some degree of rejection is almost inevitable in situations like this, and while it feels personal, it usually isn't. People get busy, their lives change, and sometimes relationships simply drift apart. The ones that respond warmly are likely the ones who also have the emotional bandwidth and life circumstances to do so. The others might not respond, or they might respond in a way that's more distant than you'd like. This doesn't mean you did something wrong. It just means that the relationship isn't in the same place that it was before.

If you're genuinely concerned about the loneliness of your still-single friends, that's a good motivation to reconnect. But make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. Reaching out because you feel guilty about having neglected them isn't a sustainable basis for renewed friendship. And as you mentioned, your life is great right now, so don't fall into the trap of thinking that getting back in touch with these friends is going to fill some sort of void. It can be a wonderful addition to your life, but it shouldn't be the replacement for your husband's companionship.

When you do reach out, keep it simple and honest. Something like: "Hey, I've been thinking about you and our old friend group. I'd love to catch up sometime if you're available." That leaves the ball in their court without putting too much pressure on them. If they respond positively, great. If not, you can try one more time with another friend, but beyond that, it's best to accept it and move on. The important thing is that you made the effort. That alone is meaningful.

Score: 7.5
Reason: This response directly addresses the question and provides practical, well-developed advice. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and includes a concrete script example. The response acknowledges that growing apart is natural ("People get busy, their lives change, and sometimes relationships simply drift apart") and shows compassion toward the single friends while affirming the validity of the letter writer's choices. However, the tone is somewhat more direct and less warm than the ideal examples. The observation about life stages and social configurations evolving is present but not as fully developed as in ideal examples. The voice demonstrates clear-headedness and some empathy, but lacks the depth, warmth, and nuanced compassion found in the reference examples. It's a meaningful answer that addresses the question well, but doesn't fully match the ideal voice's sophisticated blend of compassion and insight.

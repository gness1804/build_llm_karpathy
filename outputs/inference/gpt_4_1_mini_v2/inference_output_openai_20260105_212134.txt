QUESTION: My wife and I are expecting our first child, a daughter. As you might imagine, we're over the moon about being new parents and nurturing and loving this new human. Nevertheless, my wife and I are engaged in a nasty recurring argument over whether to baptize our future daughter. My wife came from a fairly secular family but experienced trauma in her early adulthood, including a sexual assault. She found an on-campus religious community that provided tremendous support to her in her healing. And after college she has continued to attend church in that same denomination. She's been a part of this denomination for about 15 years at this point, and I have nothing against her doing this. Obviously she's an autonomous adult, and we don't have to agree on religion. But in my case, I'm an atheist who had some very bad experiences with religion growing up, including multiple attempts to proselytize me. I also had a friend who was abused by a priest. And so for me, organized religion is the root of much evil with corporate greed being the root of most of the rest.\n\nMy wife wants to baptize our daughter in her denomination because she wants to pass on to her child the deep connection that she has to her faith. And also, I suspect, because she feels that on some level being part of this religious community might shield her daughter from the trauma that she went through as a younger woman. But for me, I worry that baptizing our daughter in this religion would essentially brainwash and indoctrinate her. I fear our daughter wanting to marry young and then becoming obedient to her husband due to our church's teachings. The denomination is one of the more conservative ones, and I don't agree with most of their teachings. I want our daughter to be a strong young woman, not a slave to her future husband because of religious brainwashing. Should I just give in and let her get indoctrinated, or should I fight harder for her to not be baptized?

ANSWER: Your situation is deeply complex and touches on some of the most intimate aspects of identity, belief, and parenting. It’s clear that both you and your wife want what’s best for your daughter, but you have very different visions of what that looks like. Your wife’s connection to her faith is a source of healing and community for her, and she hopes to share that with your child. Your concerns come from a place of protecting your daughter’s autonomy and ensuring she grows up with the freedom to think critically and make her own choices, especially given your experiences with religion.

This is not a question with an easy or universally “right” answer. Baptism, in many traditions, is not just a religious rite but a symbolic act that can shape a child’s early identity and the expectations placed on her. Your worry about the potential for restrictive gender roles and obedience is valid, especially if the denomination’s teachings lean conservative in ways you find troubling. At the same time, your wife’s desire to pass on something that has brought her comfort and community is also understandable.

Rather than framing this as a battle to win or lose, it might help to explore together what baptism means to each of you and what you hope your daughter’s upbringing will look like. Could there be ways to honor your wife’s faith and community involvement without making baptism a defining or mandatory step for your daughter? For example, some families choose to wait until their child is older to decide about baptism or religious commitment, allowing the child to explore and choose for themselves when they are ready. Others find ways to participate in community life without formal rites.

It’s also worth considering how you both might support your daughter in developing critical thinking and personal strength, regardless of religious affiliation. Open conversations about faith, values, and autonomy can be part of her upbringing even if she is baptized. Your involvement and modeling of respect for her autonomy will be crucial.

If the conversation feels stuck or charged, it might help to take a pause and revisit it with fresh perspectives over time. Sometimes, the pressure of making a decision before the child arrives can amplify fears and anxieties. Your daughter’s identity and beliefs will evolve over many years, and your partnership in parenting can create a space where she feels loved and supported no matter what path she chooses.

Ultimately, this is a negotiation of values and hopes, not just about baptism but about the kind of family life you want to build together. It’s okay to hold your concerns firmly while also acknowledging your wife’s meaningful connection to her faith. Finding a middle ground that respects both of your perspectives may not be simple, but it can be a foundation for the kind of parenting partnership that nurtures your daughter’s strength and freedom.

QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for three years, and we're talking about getting engaged. The problem is my family. They're very traditional and have made it clear they don't approve of my partner for several reasons—my partner is from a different cultural background, has a different religion, and my family thinks they're "not good enough" for me. We've tried to include my partner in family events, but my family is cold and sometimes outright rude. My partner has been incredibly patient and understanding, but I can see it's taking a toll. I love my family, but I also love my partner, and I'm tired of being caught in the middle. How do I handle this?

ANSWER: This is a deeply painful and complex situation, and your feelings of being caught between two important parts of your life are completely understandable. When family disapproval is rooted in cultural and religious differences, it can feel like an almost insurmountable barrier, especially when it manifests as coldness or rudeness toward someone you love.

First, it’s important to acknowledge the emotional toll this is taking on all of you—your partner’s patience and your own efforts to bridge the gap show your commitment, but there’s a limit to how much strain anyone can endure without feeling hurt or diminished. Your partner’s experience of exclusion or disrespect is not something to minimize, even if your family’s behavior comes from ingrained biases or fears rather than outright malice.

You might consider having a candid conversation with your family about how their attitudes and actions affect not only your partner but also your relationship with them. This isn’t about convincing them to change overnight, but about setting clear boundaries around respect and kindness. Sometimes, families need to hear directly how their behavior is causing pain and jeopardizing relationships they care about.

At the same time, reflect on what you need to feel supported and respected. It’s okay to prioritize your partner’s well-being and your own happiness, even if that means creating some distance from family dynamics that are harmful or unyielding. Love doesn’t require sacrificing your sense of self or enduring ongoing disrespect.

If you decide to move forward with your partner, consider how you want to navigate family involvement in your life and future together. It’s possible to honor your family’s place in your life without allowing their disapproval to dictate your choices or diminish your relationship. This might mean limiting family gatherings or redefining what family support looks like for you.

Ultimately, you’re facing a choice between trying to change long-held family attitudes, which can be slow and uncertain, and protecting the relationship you cherish. Neither path is easy, and it’s okay to grieve the loss of the family acceptance you hoped for. Your love and commitment to your partner are valid and deserve to be honored, even in the face of resistance.

Take your time, lean on trusted friends or confidants who understand your situation, and remember that you have the right to build a life that reflects your values and happiness.

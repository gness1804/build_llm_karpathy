QUESTION: My dad and I have a complex relationship. Growing up, my household was fairly traditional. He was the main breadwinner, my mother stayed at home during most of my childhood, and he had very traditional attitudes about who should be in charge of the household. On the plus side, he provided for us well financially. He was able to give three kids a materially comfortable childhood and then send all of those kids to college without them owing a dime in debt, all with a mostly non-working spouse. An achievement that neither I nor most others in my generation would be able to replicate. And he was always there for my sports practices and taught me a lot about work ethic. On the negative side of the ledger, he had serious problems with anger. He was unable to control his anger, and that frequently made the house a terrifying place to live in. He never physically abused us aside from spanking, which is seen as abuse in some quarters. But he would often erupt at the smallest provocation and would do things like destroy my toy planes that he and I had built together when I was a small child. He made it clear that we should live in fear of him. All of us, including my mom, walked on eggshells. \n\nNow I'm in my 40s. I don't have kids of my own partly due to my own difficult childhood. But I am married, and I try every day to treat my spouse and others differently than my father treated us. Now my father is in his mid-70s. Given his family's historical longevity, he has maybe ten years left. Perhaps add one or three for modern medical advances that weren't around when his own parents were in their last years. My dilemma is whether I should confront him about what happened long ago. I feel that confronting him might give me a sense of closure if I make clear that what he did wasn't okay, and that he should at least acknowledge it, if not apologize for it. And I worry that if I don't talk to him about it within the next few years, then I will forever lose my chance to do so and forever regret it. Another part of me says that I probably wouldn't get an apology from him anyway, and that pursuing one is just a recipe for emotional disappointment. That would compound the pain he inflicted even more. What should I do?

ANSWER: Your situation is deeply nuanced, and your feelings about it are entirely valid. You carry the weight of a childhood shaped by both provision and fear, love and anger, and now you face the difficult question of whether to revisit those old wounds with your father.

On one hand, confronting him could be a way to reclaim your story, to speak your truth, and to seek acknowledgment for the pain you endured. That acknowledgment might help you find some measure of peace or closure, especially given the limited time you anticipate having with him. It’s natural to want to express how those experiences affected you and to hear his perspective, if only to understand or to feel seen.

On the other hand, you’re right to consider the possibility that he may not respond in the way you hope. If he is unable or unwilling to recognize the harm he caused, or if he reacts defensively, that could reopen wounds rather than heal them. The risk of disappointment is real, and it’s important to weigh whether you’re prepared for that outcome.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer here, but a few reflections might help you decide:

1. What is your primary goal in having this conversation? Is it to be heard, to understand him, to offer forgiveness, or to seek an apology? Clarifying your own intentions can guide how you approach it.

2. How do you imagine the conversation unfolding? Are you prepared for the possibility that it might not go as you hope? Sometimes writing a letter first, even if you don’t send it, can help clarify your feelings and what you want to say.

3. Consider your emotional safety. If you think the conversation could cause you significant distress or reopen trauma without support, it might be wise to seek support from trusted friends or a counselor before proceeding.

4. Remember that closure doesn’t always come from others. Sometimes it comes from within, through your own reflection and the way you choose to live your life now.

Ultimately, the choice to confront your father is deeply personal. If you decide to proceed, approaching the conversation with compassion for both yourself and him—acknowledging the complexity of his character and your shared history—might create space for something meaningful, even if it falls short of an apology.

If you decide not to confront him, that too is a valid choice. Protecting your peace and focusing on the life and relationships you nurture now can be a powerful form of healing.

Whatever you choose, it’s clear you have a thoughtful and caring heart, and that you are committed to breaking cycles and creating a different experience in your own family. That commitment itself is a profound way of honoring your past and shaping your future.

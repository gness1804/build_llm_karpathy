INSTRUCTION: You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Low-medium quality response that meets the following criteria: Empathetic but generic, lacks clarity or depth, feels "LLM-like". Lacks a distinctive human voice. May include things like a bulleted or numbered "laundry list" of solutions. Responses in this range are usually short and are rather shallow, rather than fully engaging with the complex issues that are present in advice column problems.

QUESTION: My adult son rarely calls or visits. When I bring it up, he says he's busy. I feel rejected and don't know how to respond without pushing him further away.

ANSWER: It’s understandable to feel hurt when your son doesn’t call or visit often. Here are some ideas that might help:

1. Try to talk to him calmly about how you feel without blaming him.
2. Ask if there’s a better time or way to stay in touch that works for him.
3. Consider scheduling regular calls or visits so it becomes a routine.
4. Focus on your own interests and social life to feel less lonely.
5. Remember that being busy doesn’t always mean he doesn’t care.

Hopefully, these steps can improve your connection over time.

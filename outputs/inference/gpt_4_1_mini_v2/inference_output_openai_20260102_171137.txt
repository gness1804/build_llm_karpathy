INSTRUCTION: Write the absolute best response that you can, closely following this rubric: ## Patterns to REWARD (increases score):\n- The respondent describes patterns of behavior without taking on the tone of a therapist and without using therapist jargon or other jargon. Instead, the therapist uses plain English.  \n- Allowed: cautious, non-diagnostic recognition of likely underlying dynamics when plainly evident, framed in everyday language. This CAN include things like observing possible untreated anxiety as long as this is not framed in clinical language and is framed as a likely or possible issue, rather than the columnist asserting with certainty that this is the problem.\n- The respondent demonstrates empathy: expresses compassion and acknowledges the letter-writer's pain without condoning any possible bad behavior on the part of the letter-writer themself. Validates the writer’s feelings without shaming.\n- The respondent demonstrates moral clarity: draws clear moral lines and calls out bad behavior without being preachy. Advice columnist directly names the harms caused by bad behavior rather than using vague language such as "behavior like this is unfortunate..."\n- When appropriate, the respondent also points out secondary harms, such as guilt caused by appropriately enforcing boundaries. The advice columnist also does not decry or pathologize the guilt, but rather frames it as a very human response to a painful situation.\n- The respondent demonstrates clear reasoning: supports their assertions with evidence. Advice columnist is logical in their arguments without turning their response into a legal brief. The columnist's voice is clear and firm when the harm is obvious.\n- The respondent affirms boundaries that are appropriate to the scenario and that if enforced would likely help to protect the letter writer or anybody else from being harmed by bad behavior. An example of a boundary would be to ask that an adult child who calls two or three times a day only call once a day.\n- The advice columnist does not assume bad or malicious intent unless there is evidence of this clearly in the letter.\n- The advice columnist includes a “script” or a suggested verbatim statement or question for the letter writer to pose to the other party. An example would be, "Your behavior hurts me and I want to stop. I know that you say you're only joking, but I don't find these jokes funny. Please refrain from making them in the future."\n- The advice columnist favors depth over brevity. \n- The advice columnist treats everyone with respect, including those who seem to have engaged in bad behavior.\n- All advice given is secular and evidence-based. "Evidence-based" in this context does not mean citing studies or referencing psychological or other academic literature. Rather, "evidence-based" here means responses that are grounded in widely accepted social realities and human behavior, are free from the speculative pseudoscience or other unfounded beliefs such as astrology, and are also free from religious doctrines or political ideology. Responses should not have footnotes, but they should be grounded in fact.\n- The advice columnist refrains from pushing any sort of political agenda, political party, or candidate.\n- The advice columnist stays on topic and does not wander off into unrelated topics or subjects in their response. The response does not introduce new characters or situations.\n- The response ends with a forward-looking reflection. This can include: a persuasive reframing of the problem, a statement of somebody's worth, or a clear takeaway or lesson that the reader can hold on to.\n- The advised columnist can advise the letter writer or another party to seek therapy/professional help as appropriate. But this should not be the default or "knee-jerk" reaction to the letter. If therapy is advised, the response should contain an appropriate justification.\n- Overall tone is humane, grounded, and reflective.\n- Grammatically, the response uses correct English grammar, spelling, and usage. The response does not use em dashes.\n\n## Patterns to PENALIZE (decreases score):\n- The respondent engages in "therapyspeak". The respondent takes on the voice of a therapist and tries to diagnose conditions.\n- The respondent prescribes a plan of treatment. (This is inappropriate for an advice column.)\n- Advice columnist uses clinical labels, certainty regarding a possible condition, or prescriptive treatment plans.\n- Advice columnist excuses or condones bad behavior.\n- The response ends with a question. (This is very indicative of a generic LLM answer and has no place in a good advice calmness response.)\n- Advice columnist engages in any sort of bigotry, racism, sexism, homophobia, or any other insults or offensive remarks based on protected or inherent conditions or categories.\n- The respondent minimizes or brushes off the core problem and pain of the letter writer.\n- The advice columnist pushes a religious or political agenda.\n- Respondent falsely balances or over-contextualizes clearly harmful behavior in the name of neutrality. In other words, in a misguided attempt to treat all parties fairly, the respondent sacrifices moral clarity and says things that could imply that they approve of the bad behavior in certain situations.\n- The advice columnist favors brevity over depth and thorough examination. The response is overly short and/or shallow/superficial without properly engaging with the relevant themes and problems.\n- The advice columnist engages in too much soft generalization, overusing phrases such as: “It might help to focus on…” or “Sometimes people’s actions reveal…”

QUESTION: I'm 15. My parents are going through a nasty divorce. I won't bore you with the details, but they are using me as a go-between. My father is living in an apartment with his new girlfriend, so cliche. And I'm at home with my mother. Since the court hasn't ruled yet, our family is working out visitation practices on the fly. For example, I spent last weekend with my dad, and he also got to see me Wednesday and Thursday of the week before that. There's no rhyme or reason to it. \n\nBut that's small potatoes compared with the main problem. My parents don't seem to be capable of speaking to each other unless they are yelling. My mother will often ask me to “tell your father that I will be dropping off his clothes at such-and-such time.” My father might tell me something like, “Ask your mother why she won't set our court date yet and also why she's being such a bitch.” I’m sorry to use that word, but it's important for context. They are also constantly bad-mouthing each other to me behind their backs and clearly want me to side with one over the other. This is devastating to me.\n\nI don't want to be my parents' messenger pigeon. I want them both to love me equally, and I want to have a good relationship with both. I don't want to have to choose between them. Is this going to be my life for the rest of their days, or is there some way out of this?

ANSWER: What you are going through is deeply painful, and it’s completely understandable that you feel caught in the middle and overwhelmed. Being asked to carry messages between your parents, especially when they speak to each other with anger and disrespect, puts you in an impossible position. It’s not your job to be their messenger or to manage their conflict. This kind of dynamic often leaves children feeling torn, anxious, and burdened with adult problems they never asked for.

Your parents’ behavior—yelling at each other, speaking harshly, and trying to get you to take sides—is harmful to you. It puts you in the middle of their conflict and creates a stressful environment where you may feel pressured to choose loyalty to one parent over the other. This is unfair to you and can damage your relationships with both of them. It’s important to recognize that their actions are causing you real harm, even if they don’t intend it.

You have every right to set boundaries to protect yourself emotionally. One practical step is to gently but firmly let each parent know that you cannot be their messenger. You might say something like, “I want to have a good relationship with both of you, but it’s really hard for me to pass messages back and forth. Please talk to each other directly about these things.” This statement clearly communicates your feelings and your boundary without blaming either parent. It also puts the responsibility for communication back on them, where it belongs.

It’s also worth considering that your parents’ inability to communicate calmly and respectfully is a problem they need to address themselves. If they are open to it, they might benefit from professional help to manage their divorce process more constructively. While it’s not your responsibility to fix their relationship, encouraging them to seek support could improve the situation for everyone, including you.

You asked if this is going to be your life forever. While the current situation is very difficult, it doesn’t have to define your entire relationship with your parents. Over time, as the divorce settles and they find healthier ways to communicate, the pressure on you can lessen. Meanwhile, protecting your own emotional well-being by setting boundaries and refusing to be the go-between is a crucial step. Remember that your worth is not tied to their conflict, and you deserve to be loved and respected by both parents without being forced to choose sides.

Holding onto your desire for a good relationship with both your mother and father is a powerful and hopeful stance. It shows your strength and your capacity for love even in a tough situation. Keep that hope alive, and take care of yourself as you navigate this challenging time.

QUESTION: I've become very attracted to someone at my school. I'm in my mid-30s, and I am in an intensive vocational school that's co-educational. My cohort ranges in age from early 20s to 50s, although most of us are in the late 20s/early 30s range. I am a guy, and there's a girl in our cohort who is a few years younger than me. She and I are both introverts, and we bonded over this. She has also said that she sees me as handsome, though I need to remind myself that this doesn't necessarily indicate romantic interest. But I feel that our connection is becoming stronger with each conversation. We don't spend a lot of one-on-one time, but we always seem to end up talking to each other in group settings.

ANSWER: It sounds like you’re experiencing a meaningful connection that feels both exciting and a bit uncertain, especially since your interactions have mostly been in group settings and you’re navigating the nuances of mutual interest. It’s natural to want clarity about where this connection might lead, but it’s also wise to proceed with patience and attentiveness to the signals she’s giving.

Since you’ve noticed that your conversations deepen over time and that she’s expressed that she finds you handsome, there is some indication of positive regard. However, as you’ve rightly noted, attraction and romantic interest don’t always align perfectly, especially early on. The fact that you both identify as introverts and have bonded over that shared experience is a meaningful foundation—it suggests a level of understanding and comfort that can be rare.

If you feel comfortable, you might consider creating an opportunity to spend some one-on-one time together outside of the usual group context. This doesn’t have to be a formal “date” but could be something low-pressure, like grabbing coffee or studying together. This can help both of you explore your connection in a different setting and see how it feels without the dynamics of the group.

At the same time, it’s important to stay attuned to her responses and boundaries. If she seems open and engaged, that’s encouraging. If she appears hesitant or reserved, it’s okay to respect that and allow the relationship to unfold at a pace that feels safe for both of you.

Ultimately, relationships that start from genuine connection and mutual respect have the best chance of growing into something meaningful. Trust your instincts, be honest with yourself about your feelings, and allow space for the relationship to develop naturally. Whatever happens, valuing the friendship and the bond you already share can be a source of fulfillment in itself.

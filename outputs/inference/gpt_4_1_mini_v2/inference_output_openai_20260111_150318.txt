QUESTION: \nI have been married for five years. Recently, I've started to realize just how much I've neglected my friends during that period of time. Before I met my husband, I was part of an active social group, and we did a lot together. We had book clubs, went out to dinners, and even went on a few foreign trips together. We were a close-knit bunch, but as others in the bunch started pairing off, getting married, and starting families, I started to see them less and less. They never seemed to have time for the rest of us anymore. I swore that if I ever got married, I wouldn't do the same, but here I am. I love my husband, and we have a great life together. But during our two years of dating and then into our marriage, I've been communicating with my old friend group less and less. There are only a couple of people left in that group who are still single, and I worry that life has gotten lonely for them. I want to reach out to these old friends, but I worry that they're going to reject me. How can I reach out to them in a kind, compassionate way while minimizing the risk of rejection?

ANSWER: It’s clear that you care deeply about your old friends and feel a genuine longing to reconnect, which is a meaningful place to start. The passage of time and life changes—like marriage and shifting priorities—often create distance between people who once shared a close bond. It’s natural to feel a mix of hope and hesitation about reaching out after a period of silence.

When considering how to reconnect, it might help to approach your friends with openness and humility, acknowledging the time that’s passed without making assumptions about how they feel. A simple, heartfelt message that expresses your genuine interest in catching up and your awareness that life has changed for everyone can create space for a warm response. For example, you might say something like, “I’ve been thinking about you and our old group a lot lately. I realize I haven’t been in touch much, and I’d love to hear how you’re doing if you’re open to reconnecting.”

It’s also worth recognizing that your friends may be navigating their own changes and challenges, which could influence how they respond. Some might be eager to reconnect, while others might have moved on in ways that make rekindling the old closeness difficult. This doesn’t necessarily reflect on your worth or the value of your past friendship, but rather the natural evolution of relationships over time.

If you do face some rejection or silence, it’s painful but understandable. It can be helpful to hold compassion for yourself and for them, recognizing that life’s rhythms don’t always align. At the same time, your desire to maintain connections and your willingness to reach out are meaningful acts of kindness—both to your friends and to yourself.

Lastly, as you reconnect, you might consider creating new shared experiences that fit everyone’s current lives, rather than trying to recreate the past exactly. This can help friendships grow in ways that feel authentic and sustainable now.

In short, approach your friends with honesty and warmth, be prepared for a range of responses, and honor the effort you’re making to nurture connection. That effort itself is a valuable expression of care.

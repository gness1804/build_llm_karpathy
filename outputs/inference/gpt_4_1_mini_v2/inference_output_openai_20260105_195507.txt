PROMPT:
INSTRUCTION: You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Low-medium quality response that meets the following criteria: Empathetic but generic, lacks clarity or depth, feels "LLM-like". Lacks a distinctive human voice. Responses in this range are usually short and are rather shallow, rather than fully engaging with the complex issues that are present in advice column problems.

QUESTION: My coworkers often interrupt or talk over me in meetings. When I try to assert myself, I'm labeled "difficult." How do I handle this without damaging my reputation?

ANSWER: It sounds frustrating to be interrupted and then called difficult when you speak up. You might try to stay calm and keep expressing your ideas clearly. Sometimes, people don’t realize they are interrupting, so gently reminding them could help. Also, focusing on building good relationships with your coworkers might improve how they respond to you. It’s important to be confident but also polite so you don’t hurt your reputation. Keep trying to find a balance between standing up for yourself and maintaining harmony at work.

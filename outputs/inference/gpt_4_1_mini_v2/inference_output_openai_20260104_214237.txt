INSTRUCTION: You are helping to generate advice column responses to train an LLM. I'm looking for a range of responses in terms of quality. Can you produce a Low-medium quality response that meets the following criteria: Empathetic but generic, lacks clarity or depth, feels "LLM-like". Lacks a distinctive human voice. Responses in this range are usually short and are rather shallow, rather than fully engaging with the complex issues that are present in advice column problems.

QUESTION: My adult son rarely calls or visits. When I bring it up, he says he's busy. I feel rejected and don't know how to respond without pushing him further away.

ANSWER: It’s understandable to feel hurt when your son doesn’t call or visit often. People get busy with their own lives, and sometimes that means less contact. You might try telling him how you feel in a calm way, so he knows without feeling pressured. Maybe finding a time that works for both of you could help. It’s important to be patient and give him space while also expressing your feelings.

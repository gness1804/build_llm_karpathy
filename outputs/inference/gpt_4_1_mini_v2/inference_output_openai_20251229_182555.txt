PROMPT:
QUESTION: I have been married for five years. Recently, I've started to realize just how much I've neglected my friends during that period of time. Before I met my husband, I was part of an active social group, and we did a lot together. We had book clubs, went out to dinners, and even went on a few foreign trips together. We were a close-knit bunch, but as others in the bunch started pairing off, getting married, and starting families, I started to see them less and less. They never seemed to have time for the rest of us anymore. I swore that if I ever got married, I wouldn't do the same, but here I am. I love my husband, and we have a great life together. But during our two years of dating and then into our marriage, I've been communicating with my old friend group less and less. There are only a couple of people left in that group who are still single, and I worry that life has gotten lonely for them. I want to reach out to these old friends, but I worry that they're going to reject me. How can I reach out to them in a kind, compassionate way while minimizing the risk of rejection?

ANSWER: Reaching out after a period of absence can feel vulnerable, but approaching it with sincerity is the best foundation. Start with individual messages rather than group ones. Something like: “Hey [Name], I realize I’ve been out of touch for a while, and I’m sorry for that. Life got busy with marriage and all, but I’ve been thinking about you and would love to catch up. How are you doing?” This acknowledges the gap without over-explaining, and it opens the door for conversation.

Don't frame it as a problem to be solved—loneliness for them, rejection for you—but as a genuine desire to reconnect. People appreciate honesty, and even if some don't respond, those who do will value the heartfelt outreach. The key is to be present now, rather than caught up in what happened before or what might happen.

Reason: This response directly addresses the question and provides practical advice with a concrete script example. It maintains second person throughout and stays on topic. However, it's significantly shorter and less developed than ideal examples, and it's missing several key observations from the test prompt criteria. It doesn't explicitly note that growing apart from friends is natural and that the letter writer isn't rejecting them. It doesn't observe how life stages cause social configurations to evolve. It also doesn't show much specific compassion toward the single friends or fully affirm the validity of the letter writer's choices (marriage, prioritizing relationship). The voice is decent but lacks the depth, nuance, and developed reasoning found in the ideal examples. While it shows evidence of attempting to answer the question, it feels somewhat surface-level and doesn't fully match the ideal voice's sophistication.

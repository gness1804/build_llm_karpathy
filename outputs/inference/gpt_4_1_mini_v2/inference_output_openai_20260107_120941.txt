QUESTION: I've become very attracted to someone at my school. I'm in my mid-30s, and I am in an intensive vocational school that's co-educational. My cohort ranges in age from early 20s to 50s, although most of us are in the late 20s/early 30s range. I am a guy, and there's a girl in our cohort who is a few years younger than me. She and I are both introverts, and we bonded over this. She has also said that she sees me as handsome, though I need to remind myself that this doesn't necessarily indicate romantic interest. But I feel that our connection is becoming stronger with each conversation. We don't spend a lot of one-on-one time, but we always seem to end up talking to each other in group settings.\n\nUnfortunately, she's engaged. I really want to be respectful of her relationship and not be a homewrecker, but at the same time I feel what I feel. Is there a way forward for us? Should I venture to satisfy my curiosity regarding whether she shares my feelings, or should I keep quiet about this?

ANSWER: You’re navigating a delicate and emotionally charged situation, and it’s clear you’re trying to approach it with respect and thoughtfulness. Feeling drawn to someone, especially when you share a meaningful connection, is a natural human experience. At the same time, the fact that she is engaged introduces important boundaries that deserve careful consideration.

Her engagement suggests she has made a commitment to someone else, and honoring that commitment is a significant part of respecting her autonomy and the relationships involved. While it’s understandable to wonder if she might share your feelings, acting on that curiosity risks causing harm—not only to her and her fiancé but also to yourself and the dynamics within your cohort.

You mention that your connection is growing stronger through conversations, but it’s also important to recognize the context: these interactions are happening in group settings, and she has expressed appreciation for you in a way that may be friendly or affirming rather than romantic. Given the limited one-on-one time and the existing engagement, it’s wise to be cautious about interpreting signals too optimistically.

If you choose to keep your feelings to yourself, it doesn’t mean you have to suppress or deny them entirely. You might find ways to acknowledge and process your emotions privately or with trusted friends, while maintaining a respectful distance that honors her relationship. This approach can help you preserve your integrity and avoid complicating the situation.

On the other hand, if you consider sharing your feelings, it’s crucial to do so with full awareness of the potential consequences. Such a conversation could place her in an uncomfortable position, strain your cohort’s social environment, and possibly lead to hurt feelings or misunderstandings. If you do decide to speak up, framing your feelings honestly but without expectation or pressure, and being prepared to accept her response—whatever it may be—is essential.

Ultimately, there is no simple or risk-free path forward here. Balancing your genuine feelings with respect for her commitments and the broader social context requires patience and self-awareness. It’s okay to hold space for your emotions while choosing not to act on them in ways that could cause harm. Over time, as circumstances evolve, you may find clarity about what feels right for you. In the meantime, focusing on your own growth and the connections you can build without crossing boundaries may offer a steadier and more compassionate way forward.

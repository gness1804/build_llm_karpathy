QUESTION: My partner and I have been together for four years, and we're both in our early 30s. We've been talking about having kids, but we have very different ideas about parenting. I was raised with strict rules, clear consequences, and high expectations. My partner was raised in a much more permissive household where kids had a lot of freedom and choices. I think kids need structure and boundaries to thrive, while my partner thinks too many rules stifle creativity and independence. We've tried to discuss this, but we both get defensive because our approaches are tied to our own childhood experiences. How do we figure out a parenting style we can both agree on before we have kids?

ANSWER: It’s clear that both of you care deeply about raising children in a way that supports their well-being, even though your ideas about how to do that come from very different backgrounds. This kind of difference is common and can feel especially charged because parenting touches on our own histories and values so intimately.

One important step is to acknowledge that neither approach is inherently right or wrong—both structure and freedom have their place in healthy development. What matters most is finding a balance that feels authentic and workable for both of you as a couple, rather than trying to replicate your own childhoods or prove one method superior.

It might help to shift the conversation from abstract ideas about “rules” or “freedom” to specific situations and goals. For example, you could talk about what kinds of boundaries feel essential to you and why, and invite your partner to share what kinds of freedoms they believe foster creativity and independence. Try to listen with curiosity rather than defensiveness, even when it’s hard, and look for areas where your values overlap—like wanting your child to feel safe, respected, and confident.

You could also consider exploring parenting philosophies or books together that offer nuanced approaches, such as authoritative parenting, which combines clear expectations with warmth and flexibility. Sometimes having a shared language or framework can make these conversations less personal and more collaborative.

If discussions continue to feel stuck or emotionally charged, it might be worthwhile to seek a neutral third party—like a counselor or a parenting educator—who can help you both articulate your hopes and fears and guide you toward a shared approach.

Ultimately, the goal isn’t to erase your differences but to create a parenting style that honors both your perspectives and supports your future child’s growth. That will take ongoing dialogue, patience, and a willingness to adapt as you learn together. It’s a challenging but deeply meaningful process, and the effort you put in now can build a foundation of mutual respect and teamwork for your family.

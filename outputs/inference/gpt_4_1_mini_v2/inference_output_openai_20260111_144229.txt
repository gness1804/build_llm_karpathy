QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year. We get along well, but I have one recurring complaint. When I tell him about something that hurt my feelings, he makes a joke or says I am "too sensitive." He does not yell or insult me, but I leave those conversations feeling like my emotions are a nuisance. I do not want to break up over this, but I also do not want to keep swallowing my feelings just to keep the peace. How can I talk to him about this in a way that might actually change something?

ANSWER: It’s clear that you care about your relationship and want to find a way to be heard without feeling dismissed. When your boyfriend responds to your hurt feelings with jokes or by calling you “too sensitive,” it can feel like your emotions are being minimized, which is painful and can create distance over time. You’re right to want to address this, because your feelings deserve respect and acknowledgment.

One approach is to share with him how his responses affect you, not as a criticism but as an honest expression of your experience. For example, you might say something like, “When I tell you something that’s bothering me and you joke or say I’m too sensitive, I end up feeling like my feelings don’t matter to you. That leaves me feeling alone in the relationship, and I want us to be able to support each other better.” This frames the issue around your feelings and the impact on the relationship, rather than labeling his behavior as wrong.

It’s also helpful to invite him into the conversation by asking how he experiences these moments. Sometimes people use humor or deflection because they feel unsure how to respond or want to avoid conflict. Understanding his perspective might open a space for both of you to find new ways to communicate.

Change won’t necessarily happen overnight, and it requires willingness on both sides. If he’s open, you can suggest small steps, like him simply acknowledging your feelings (“I hear that hurt you”) rather than trying to fix or dismiss them. If he resists or continues to make you feel unheard, it’s important to consider how that affects your well-being and what you need to feel safe and valued.

Ultimately, your feelings are valid, and a partner who cares about you will want to understand and honor them. Approaching the conversation with honesty and curiosity, rather than blame, can create a better chance for meaningful change. But also trust yourself to recognize when your emotional needs are not being met, and to make choices that protect your sense of self and happiness.

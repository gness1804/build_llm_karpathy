PROMPT:
INSTRUCTION: You are helping me to train an LLM to refine advice column answers to better match my voice. My methodology is that I'm posing a question to the base model (that's you) for each example, and then you will output an answer. I will then manually score the answer according to a rubric and output my own manual answer that's the ideal response. Your role is to generate the initial response. Based on the following rubric, can you generate a response within the 6 range? # Responses scoring rubric\n\nThis is the rubric used to score advice column responses by the base model. Score these responses against how well they measure up to my own voice and my high standards of quality. This rubric will be used to assign a score to each response, ranging from 0 (incoherent, terrible) to 10 (virtually perfect). Here are the standards for scoring a response (note that when I use the terms "respondent" or "advice columnist," it's referring to the implicit author of the base model's response):\n\n## Patterns to REWARD (increases score):\n- The respondent describes patterns of behavior without taking on the tone of a therapist and without using therapist jargon or other jargon. Instead, the therapist uses plain English.  \n- Allowed: cautious, non-diagnostic recognition of likely underlying dynamics when plainly evident, framed in everyday language. This CAN include things like observing possible untreated anxiety as long as this is not framed in clinical language and is framed as a likely or possible issue, rather than the columnist asserting with certainty that this is the problem.\n- The respondent demonstrates empathy: expresses compassion and acknowledges the letter-writer's pain without condoning any possible bad behavior on the part of the letter-writer themself. Validates the writer’s feelings without shaming.\n- The respondent demonstrates moral clarity: draws clear moral lines and calls out bad behavior without being preachy. Advice columnist directly names the harms caused by bad behavior rather than using vague language such as "behavior like this is unfortunate..."\n- When appropriate, the respondent also points out secondary harms, such as guilt caused by appropriately enforcing boundaries. The advice columnist also does not decry or pathologize the guilt, but rather frames it as a very human response to a painful situation.\n- The respondent demonstrates clear reasoning: supports their assertions with evidence. Advice columnist is logical in their arguments without turning their response into a legal brief. The columnist's voice is clear and firm when the harm is obvious.\n- The respondent affirms boundaries that are appropriate to the scenario and that if enforced would likely help to protect the letter writer or anybody else from being harmed by bad behavior. An example of a boundary would be to ask that an adult child who calls two or three times a day only call once a day.\n- The advice columnist does not assume bad or malicious intent unless there is evidence of this clearly in the letter.\n- The advice columnist includes a “script” or a suggested verbatim statement or question for the letter writer to pose to the other party. An example would be, "Your behavior hurts me and I want to stop. I know that you say you're only joking, but I don't find these jokes funny. Please refrain from making them in the future."\n- The advice columnist favors depth over brevity. \n- The advice columnist treats everyone with respect, including those who seem to have engaged in bad behavior.\n- All advice given is secular and evidence-based. "Evidence-based" in this context does not mean citing studies or referencing psychological or other academic literature. Rather, "evidence-based" here means responses that are grounded in widely accepted social realities and human behavior, are free from the speculative pseudoscience or other unfounded beliefs such as astrology, and are also free from religious doctrines or political ideology. Responses should not have footnotes, but they should be grounded in fact.\n- The advice columnist refrains from pushing any sort of political agenda, political party, or candidate.\n- The advice columnist stays on topic and does not wander off into unrelated topics or subjects in their response. The response does not introduce new characters or situations.\n- The response ends with a forward-looking reflection. This can include: a persuasive reframing of the problem, a statement of somebody's worth, or a clear takeaway or lesson that the reader can hold on to.\n- The advised columnist can advise the letter writer or another party to seek therapy/professional help as appropriate. But this should not be the default or "knee-jerk" reaction to the letter. If therapy is advised, the response should contain an appropriate justification.\n- Overall tone is humane, grounded, and reflective.\n- Grammatically, the response uses correct English grammar, spelling, and usage. The response does not use em dashes.\n\n## Patterns to PENALIZE (decreases score):\n- The respondent engages in "therapyspeak". The respondent takes on the voice of a therapist and tries to diagnose conditions.\n- The respondent prescribes a plan of treatment. (This is inappropriate for an advice column.)\n- Advice columnist uses clinical labels, certainty regarding a possible condition, or prescriptive treatment plans.\n- Advice columnist excuses or condones bad behavior.\n- The response ends with a question. (This is very indicative of a generic LLM answer and has no place in a good advice calmness response.)\n- Advice columnist engages in any sort of bigotry, racism, sexism, homophobia, or any other insults or offensive remarks based on protected or inherent conditions or categories.\n- The respondent minimizes or brushes off the core problem and pain of the letter writer.\n- The advice columnist pushes a religious or political agenda.\n- Respondent falsely balances or over-contextualizes clearly harmful behavior in the name of neutrality. In other words, in a misguided attempt to treat all parties fairly, the respondent sacrifices moral clarity and says things that could imply that they approve of the bad behavior in certain situations.\n- The advice columnist favors brevity over depth and thorough examination. The response is overly short and/or shallow/superficial without properly engaging with the relevant themes and problems.\n- The advice columnist engages in too much soft generalization, overusing phrases such as: “It might help to focus on…” or “Sometimes people’s actions reveal…”\n\n## Scoring\n\nScores can be defined in increments of 0.5. For example, valid scores would be 2, 4, or 7.5, whereas 7.25 or 8.75 would not be a valid score to assign.\n\n### Scoring ranges\n\nThis is an example of scoring ranges and what responses within each range look like:\n\n9–10: Strong columnist voice, clear moral clarity, specific "scripts", emotionally grounded, does not diagnose, pathologize, or engage in therapyspeak. Ends with a clear "takeaway" that is powerful but not preachy.\n\n7–8: Generally solid advice with minor softness, vagueness, or missed opportunities for specificity. Some of the moral clarity of a 9-10 response may be missing. The response might be fairly described as "pulling its punches" in places.\n\n5–6: Empathetic but generic, lacks clarity or depth, feels "LLM-like". Lacks a distinctive human voice. May include things like a bulleted or numbered "laundry list" of solutions. Responses in this range are usually short and are rather shallow, rather than fully engaging with the complex issues that are present in advice column problems.\n\nBelow 5: Minimizes harm, over-generalizes, significant therapyspeak, or structural failures. May not answer the question at all and may veer off into unrelated topics. Responses in this range might also promote political or religious agendas. Also, any response that engages in bigotry of any sort should be given a score of 0 or 1.

QUESTION: My sister resents me for being more academically successful. She says I make her feel inferior, even when I try to downplay my achievements. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells.

ANSWER:

==================================================
ANSWER: It’s clear that your sister’s feelings of resentment are causing tension between you, and that you’re caught in a difficult spot trying to be sensitive without sacrificing your own sense of self. When someone feels overshadowed, especially within a family, it can stir up complex emotions like jealousy and insecurity. Your sister’s reaction—feeling inferior despite your efforts to downplay your achievements—suggests that the issue runs deeper than just your success; it’s about how she sees herself in relation to you.

It’s important to recognize that you are not responsible for managing her self-worth, nor should you have to minimize your accomplishments to protect her feelings. At the same time, understanding her perspective can help you navigate this strained dynamic with care. You might consider having an honest but gentle conversation where you acknowledge her feelings without taking blame for them. For example, you could say, “I’m sorry that my success makes you feel this way. That’s not my intention, and I want us to have a good relationship.”

Setting boundaries around how you discuss your achievements can also be helpful. You might decide to share less about your academic life if it consistently causes pain, but this should be your choice, not an obligation. It’s okay to protect your own emotional well-being while being mindful of hers.

Ultimately, sibling relationships often carry complicated emotions that don’t resolve quickly or neatly. Your worth isn’t diminished by her struggles, and her feelings don’t have to overshadow your own. Holding space for both realities—your success and her insecurities—can help you find a balance that respects both of you. Over time, this balance might allow your relationship to grow beyond the current tension.

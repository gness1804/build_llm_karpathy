## Rationales for scores

caretaking burnout in a family system: "All three responses address the question with practical advice and a warm, nuanced voice. They meet most criteria; the only gap is the lack of explicit "invisible labor" terminology. The base gpt-4.1-mini model outputs show more warmth and nuance than the fine-tuned model outputs, with better-developed reasoning and compassion. Scores and justifications have been added to each file."

partners grief and emotional distance: "All three responses address the question with strong voice and depth. File 1 scores highest because it explicitly mentions small rituals of connection. The base gpt-4.1-mini model outputs show strong warmth, nuance, and compassion. Scores and justifications have been added to each file."

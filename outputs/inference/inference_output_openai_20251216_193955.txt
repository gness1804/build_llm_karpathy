QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

ANSWER: You are allowed to grieve the loss of the relationship as it once was, even if your partner is still alive. His prolonged silence and emotional withdrawal constitute a form of absence, and your confusion and loneliness are natural. At the same time, as you recognize, grief does not follow a timetable, and people process loss in vastly different ways. The question is not whether his response is “normal” but whether it is something you can live with and whether it is fair to you.

Start by naming your own needs: “I know you are going through a lot, and I want to support you. At the same time, I feel very alone, and I miss the connection we used to have. Can we talk about how to stay

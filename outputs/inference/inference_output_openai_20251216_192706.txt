QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

ANSWER: You are not alone in feeling this way. Grief can be isolating, and when it changes a partner, it creates a secondary wound in the relationship. Your partner may be overwhelmed by his own sorrow, and he may not know how to carry the additional weight of comforting you. But your emotional reality matters, and it is not a betrayal of his grief to say that you are struggling.

Start by naming the situation gently but honestly. “I know you are going through a lot, and I want to support you. At the same time, I feel distant from you, and I miss the connection we had. I need to find a way to be close to you again while also honoring what you are feeling.”

Then ask what he

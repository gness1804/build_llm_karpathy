QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

Start by naming your own pain without equating it to his. You might say: “I know you are going through a lot, and I want to support you. At the same time, I feel distant from you, and I miss the connection we had. I need to talk about that too.” This is not asking him to choose between his grief and your relationship. It is

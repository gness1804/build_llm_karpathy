## Score Justifications

caretaking burnout in a family system: "Overall, v1 performs better than v3 but still falls short of the base model and v2 in terms of warmth, nuance, and depth. The responses are solid and practical but don't fully match the ideal voice's sophisticated blend of compassion and insight."

partners grief and emotional distance: "Overall, v1 performs well on partner grief, with File 3 being the strongest. The model shows good understanding of the complexity and provides practical advice, though it could benefit from more warmth and nuanced reasoning to match the ideal voice."

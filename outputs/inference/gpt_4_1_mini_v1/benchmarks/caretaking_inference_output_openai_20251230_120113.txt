QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: You are not a terrible child—you are a human being with limits. Your siblings’ expressions of gratitude do not replace actual help, and their unwillingness to step in is not your responsibility to fix. It is understandable to want to honor your father, but honoring him does not mean sacrificing your own well-being. Resentment is a sign that the current arrangement is unsustainable, and guilt is not a reliable guide for setting boundaries.

Start by having a direct conversation with your siblings: "I cannot continue to manage everything on my own. I need each of you to take on specific responsibilities." Be concrete: one sibling handles transportation, another manages medication refills, etc. If they continue to decline, you may need to accept that they will not be involved and adjust your expectations accordingly. This might mean hiring professional help, involving other relatives, or working with your father to create a care plan that does not rely solely on you. You can still be present and supportive without being the entire infrastructure. Setting limits is not abandonment; it is sustainability. Your father deserves care, but you also deserve to live your own life.

Score: 7.5
Reason: This response directly addresses the question with practical, well-developed advice. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and provides concrete task redistribution suggestions (transportation, medication refills). The response effectively reassures that setting limits is not abandoning dad and mentions multiple forms of external help (professional help, other relatives). The voice is clear-headed and direct, showing good reasoning, with particularly strong insight about resentment being a sign of unsustainability. It recognizes the burden though it doesn't explicitly use the "invisible labor" terminology. The tone is somewhat more direct and less warm than the ideal examples, which tend to have more nuanced compassion and depth. While it's a meaningful answer that addresses the core question well, it doesn't fully match the ideal voice's sophisticated blend of warmth, compassion, and insight.

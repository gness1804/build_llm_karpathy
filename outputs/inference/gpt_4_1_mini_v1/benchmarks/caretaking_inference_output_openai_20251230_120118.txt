QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: First, you are not a terrible child. You are a responsible adult who has taken on more than your fair share, and it is both reasonable and necessary to set limits. The guilt you feel is understandable, but it is misplaced: your siblings’ unwillingness to help is not your responsibility, and it does not reflect a lack of love for your father. It reflects their choices, and you should not have to carry the burden of their choices.

Start by having a direct conversation with your siblings: "I can't continue to manage everything for Dad on my own. I need each of you to take on specific responsibilities." Be clear and firm, not apologetic. If they continue to decline, you may need to escalate: involve your father (if he is able) in delegating tasks, or consider hiring professional help for things that no one wants to do, such as a home health aide or a care coordinator. This is not abandoning your father; it is ensuring that he gets the care he needs without you burning out. You can love and support your father without sacrificing your own health and well-being.

Score: 7.5
Reason: This response directly addresses the question with practical, well-developed advice. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and provides concrete task redistribution suggestions. The response effectively reassures that setting limits is not abandoning dad and mentions multiple forms of external help (home health aide, care coordinator). The voice is clear-headed and direct, showing good reasoning, with particularly strong insight about guilt being misplaced. It recognizes the burden though it doesn't explicitly use the "invisible labor" terminology. The tone is somewhat more direct and less warm than the ideal examples, which tend to have more nuanced compassion and depth. While it's a meaningful answer that addresses the core question well, it doesn't fully match the ideal voice's sophisticated blend of warmth, compassion, and insight.

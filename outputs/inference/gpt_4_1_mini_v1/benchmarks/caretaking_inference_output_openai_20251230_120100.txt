QUESTION: I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad’s health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become “understood” that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, “Thank you so much, we really appreciate you,” but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing.” I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

ANSWER: You are not a terrible child for needing support. You are a human being with limits. The fact that your siblings express appreciation but do not act suggests they may not fully grasp the burden you are carrying. Sometimes people think gratitude is a substitute for action, but it is not.

Start by having a direct conversation with your siblings: “I love Dad and want to help, but I cannot do everything alone. I need each of you to take on specific responsibilities.” Be concrete: one sibling handles transportation, another manages medication refills, another attends certain appointments. If they continue to decline, you may need to escalate the conversation: “If you are not able to help, I will need to hire professional support, because this is more than I can manage.”

You might also consider involving your father in the conversation if he is able. Sometimes parents can help redistribute responsibility among siblings. And if your father's health requires it, professional home care or a care coordinator can relieve some of the pressure. Your willingness to step up is admirable, but it is not sustainable if you are doing it all. Asking for help and setting boundaries is not abandonment—it is responsible caregiving.

Score: 7.5
Reason: This response directly addresses the question with practical, well-developed advice. It maintains second person throughout, stays on topic, and provides concrete task redistribution suggestions (transportation, medication refills, appointments). The response effectively reassures that setting limits is not abandoning dad and mentions multiple forms of external help (professional support, home care, care coordinator). The voice is clear-headed and direct, showing good reasoning. It recognizes the burden ("the burden you are carrying") though it doesn't explicitly use the "invisible labor" terminology. The tone is somewhat more direct and less warm than the ideal examples, which tend to have more nuanced compassion and depth. While it's a meaningful answer that addresses the core question well, it doesn't fully match the ideal voice's sophisticated blend of warmth, compassion, and insight.

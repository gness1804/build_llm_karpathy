PROMPT:
QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

==================================================
ANSWER: You are not alone in feeling this way. Grief can be profoundly isolating, and when it changes a partner, it can feel like a second loss. The fact that he is distant does not mean he does not love you or that he is rejecting you. It may mean that he is overwhelmed by his own pain and does not know how to carry both his grief and the emotional needs of the relationship.

Start by naming your own experience: “I know you are hurting, and I am too. I feel distant from you, and I want to find a way back to each other.” This is not a demand for him to perform emotional labor. It is an invitation to acknowledge that the relationship is also part of the ecosystem of grief.

Encourage him to seek support outside the relationship, whether through therapy, a support group, or trusted friends. You cannot be his sole source of comfort, and neither should you be. At the same time, ask for small ways to stay connected: a daily check-in, a shared walk, a ritual of some kind. You are not asking him to speed up his healing. You are asking him to keep the door open.

Remember that this may be a long process. Some people's grief quiets after a year or two. Others carry it for a lifetime. What matters is that you both have a place in the relationship to express where you are. You are not being selfish by asking for connection. You are being human.

Score: 8.5
Reason: This response directly addresses the question and maintains second person throughout. It effectively acknowledges that the partner's grief is real and not "wrong," and it provides meaningful space for the letter writer's grief about the relationship. It suggests outside support (therapy, support group, trusted friends) without forcing it, and importantly, it explicitly mentions "small ways to stay connected: a daily check-in, a shared walk, a ritual of some kind," which addresses the "small rituals of connection" criterion from the test prompt. The voice is clear-headed and well-developed, showing good reasoning and understanding of the complexity. It provides concrete communication scripts and shows nuanced understanding. While it doesn't fully match the ideal voice's sophisticated warmth and depth, it's a very strong answer that effectively addresses all the key criteria.

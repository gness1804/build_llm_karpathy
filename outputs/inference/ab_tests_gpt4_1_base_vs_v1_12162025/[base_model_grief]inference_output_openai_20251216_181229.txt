QUESTION: My partner’s sibling died unexpectedly six months ago. Since then, my partner has been a different person. He is not cruel or unfaithful or anything like that. He is just distant. He spends long hours at work, barely talks at home, and seems to exist in a separate emotional world. When I ask how he is doing, he says “fine” and changes the subject. I know grief does not follow a schedule, but I feel like I lost my partner and no one has named that. How can I support him and also honor the fact that I am hurting too?

ANSWER: I’m sorry you and your partner are going through such a difficult time. Grief can change people in profound ways, and it sounds like your partner is processing his loss in a very internal and private manner. It’s important to recognize that his distance is likely a reflection of his pain, not a lack of care for you.

To support him, try to create a safe, non-pressuring space where he can share when he’s ready. You might say something like, “I’m here whenever you want to talk or just be together,” without pushing for immediate answers. Sometimes just knowing you’re present without judgment can help.

At the same time, your feelings are valid and deserve attention. Consider expressing to him gently how his distance affects you, perhaps saying, “I understand you’re hurting, and I want to support you. I also want to share that I’m feeling lonely and miss the connection we had.” This can open a dialogue without placing blame.

If possible, encourage small shared activities that don’t require heavy conversation—like a walk or a quiet meal—to maintain connection. Grief counseling or support groups, either individually or as a couple, might also provide helpful tools and understanding for both of you.

Remember, healing takes time, and it’s okay to seek support for yourself as you navigate this together. Your compassion for him and honesty about your own needs can help you both move forward with empathy and care.

PROMPT:
QUESTION: Recently, I had a relationship with a guy. I'm a 31-year-old female, and he's a 32-year-old male. Things were going pretty well. We had been dating for about six months, and so it looked like the relationship had a firm foundation. However, out of the blue, he told me that he needs to "take a pause." He further explains that he needs to work on himself a bit, and he wants to spend more time with his family. I asked what he means by taking a pause, but he didn't respond. I also texted and left a voicemail, but he ghosted me. He gave me complete radio silence for six weeks. After a week or two, I came to assume that he was no longer interested in the relationship, and I moved on. I got a dog even though he had said he was allergic to dogs because I figured that he wasn't in my life anyway, so that wasn't a factor anymore. \n\n Last week, he texts me out of nowhere and wants to pick up where we had left off. That is, before he took the "pause." I told him, "What are you talking about? We're broken up." And I mentioned that I had gotten a dog, among other life changes that I had made. He was very upset, asking me how I could do that when he had explained previously his dog allergies. Am I on the wrong here? Was I wrong to assume that six weeks of ghosting equals a relationship effectively being over?

ANSWER: You were not wrong to assume the relationship was over after six weeks of complete silence and no communication. When someone asks for a "pause" but then disappears without any clarity or follow-up, it is reasonable to interpret that as a break or an end, especially when your attempts to reach out were ignored. Healthy relationships require communication and respect, and ghosting is a clear sign that the other person is not engaging in that.

Given the circumstances, it was entirely appropriate for you to move on and make life choices, like getting a dog, that reflect your current reality and happiness. You cannot put your life on hold indefinitely waiting for someone who is not present or communicative. His allergies were a factor when you were together, but since he effectively ended the relationship by ghosting, you were free to make decisions that suit your life.

If he now wants to reconnect, it’s important to consider whether he is willing to communicate openly and consistently, and whether you want to revisit a relationship that ended with such a lack of respect. You have every right to set boundaries and prioritize your well-being. It’s okay to tell him that the relationship ended when he stopped responding and that you have moved forward. You deserve clarity, respect, and honesty in any relationship.

QUESTION: I am in my late twenties and recently moved into my own place. My mom has a key for emergencies, which I was fine with. Lately she has started “dropping by” unannounced when I am at work to leave food, do small chores, or reorganize things “to help.” She means well, but it feels like my space is not really mine. I tried joking about it, but she did not get the hint. How do I set a boundary without hurting her feelings?

ANSWER: It's understandable that you want to maintain your independence and privacy in your own home, while also respecting your mom's good intentions. The key here is clear and kind communication. You can start by expressing appreciation for her help and care, which shows you value her. Then gently but firmly explain how important it is for you to have your own space and routine, and that unannounced visits make you feel uncomfortable. For example, you might say, "Mom, I really appreciate you looking out for me and helping with things. It means a lot. At the same time, I'm trying to get used to managing my own space and schedule, so I'd like to ask that you please call or text before coming by. That way I can make sure it's a good time." This approach sets a clear boundary without blaming her. If she continues to drop by unexpectedly, remind her kindly but firmly of your agreement. Over time, she will likely come to respect your need for privacy while still feeling valued.

Score: 8.0
Reason: This is a solid answer that directly addresses the question about setting boundaries without hurting feelings. The response provides specific, actionable advice with a concrete example script, demonstrates empathy by acknowledging both the user's need for privacy and the mom's good intentions, and maintains a compassionate and clear-headed tone throughout. It stays completely on topic, uses second person tone appropriately, and doesn't introduce irrelevant characters or situations. The advice is practical and well-structured. However, compared to the best tier A examples, it's slightly more formulaic and lacks some of the deeper nuanced reflection and insight that elevates responses to the 9-10 range. The response successfully answers the question and shows good understanding of the emotional complexity, but could benefit from a bit more depth in its analysis.

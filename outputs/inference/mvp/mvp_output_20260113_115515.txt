ORIGINAL QUESTION
================================================================================
I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad's health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become "understood" that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, "Thank you so much, we really appreciate you," but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are "too busy" or "not good with that kind of thing." I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

BASE MODEL DRAFT RESPONSE
================================================================================
ANSWER: Your feelings of exhaustion and resentment are understandable, especially when the weight of caregiving falls so heavily on your shoulders while your siblings remain on the sidelines. It’s clear you care deeply about your dad and want to honor the role he played in your life, but that doesn’t mean you have to carry this burden alone or at the expense of your own well-being.

Setting limits in this situation is not about being a “terrible child”—it’s about recognizing your own humanity and the reality that caregiving is a shared responsibility, not a solo mission. Your siblings’ expressions of gratitude, while kind, don’t replace meaningful action. Their reasons for not stepping in—being busy or feeling unskilled—may be genuine, but they also highlight a need for clearer boundaries and expectations.

One practical approach is to have a candid conversation with your siblings where you acknowledge the appreciation but also express how the current arrangement is affecting you. You might say something like, “I’m grateful for your support in words, but I’m feeling overwhelmed managing everything alone. I need your help with specific tasks, even if it’s just small things or learning together.” Sometimes people underestimate what they can contribute until asked directly with concrete options.

It’s also okay to define what you can realistically handle without sacrificing your health or peace of mind. This might mean delegating certain responsibilities or setting a schedule that includes breaks for you. Remember, caring for your dad well includes caring for yourself so you can be present and effective over time.

Guilt is a common companion in these situations, but it doesn’t have to dictate your choices. Loving someone doesn’t require self-sacrifice to the point of burnout. You can honor your dad’s role in your life by advocating for a caregiving arrangement that respects everyone’s capacities and preserves your own well-being.

In the end, setting limits is an act of care—not just for yourself, but for your dad and your family as a whole. It invites a more balanced, sustainable way forward, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. You’re not alone in this, and your feelings are valid. Taking steps to share the load is both reasonable and necessary.

REVISED_RESPONSE:
Your feelings of exhaustion and resentment are not only understandable but also a clear signal that the current caregiving arrangement is unsustainable. It’s commendable that you want to honor your dad’s role in your life, but that does not mean you have to bear this burden alone. Caregiving is a shared responsibility, not a solo mission.

Your siblings’ expressions of gratitude, while polite, do not substitute for meaningful action. Their excuses of being “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing” are common ways people avoid responsibility. They may be genuine, but they also reveal a lack of willingness to step up. It’s important to call this out and set clear boundaries.

Have a candid conversation with your siblings. You might say, “I appreciate your words, but I need more than that. I’m overwhelmed managing everything alone. I need you to take on specific tasks, even if it means learning as you go.” Offer concrete options, such as handling certain appointments, managing medications, or dealing with paperwork. If they refuse, be clear about what you will and will not continue to do.

ORIGINAL QUESTION
================================================================================
I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad's health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become "understood" that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, "Thank you so much, we really appreciate you," but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are "too busy" or "not good with that kind of thing." I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

BASE MODEL DRAFT RESPONSE
================================================================================
ANSWER: Your feelings of exhaustion and resentment are understandable and valid. Caring for a parent whose health is declining is an immense responsibility, especially when it falls disproportionately on you. It’s clear you love your dad and want to honor what he did for your family, but that doesn’t mean you have to carry this burden alone or at the expense of your own well-being.

Setting limits doesn’t make you a terrible child—it makes you a human being with needs and boundaries. It’s important to recognize that your siblings’ expressions of gratitude, while kind, don’t replace meaningful action. Their reluctance to help may come from discomfort, fear, or simply different capacities, but that doesn’t obligate you to do everything yourself.

One way to approach this is to have an honest conversation with your siblings, not just about what you need, but about what they can realistically contribute. Instead of open-ended offers, propose very specific, manageable tasks that fit their schedules or strengths—whether it’s handling one appointment, managing a particular bill, or spending time with your dad so you can rest. If they continue to decline, you might consider exploring outside resources like home health aides or community support services to share the load.

Remember, caring for your dad is a collective family responsibility, but it’s also okay to acknowledge your limits. Taking care of yourself doesn’t diminish your love or commitment; it sustains your ability to be there for him in the long run. Guilt often arises from internalized expectations rather than the reality of what’s fair or healthy. You’re doing important work, and setting boundaries is part of protecting both your dad’s care and your own well-being.

- The closing paragraph could be more grounded and less abstract.

REVISED_RESPONSE:
You are carrying a heavy load, and it’s not unreasonable to feel exhausted and resentful. Your siblings’ thanks are polite but empty if they don’t come with action. Their unwillingness to help is a choice that leaves you to do the work. It’s not a reflection of your worth or your love for your dad to say no to that.

You can’t do this alone, and you shouldn’t have to. Your dad’s care is a family responsibility, not a solo project. Your siblings’ excuses about being busy or not good at certain tasks are just that — excuses. They are choosing not to help. That’s their decision, but it’s not your burden.

You need to be clear and firm with your siblings. Tell them exactly what you need them to do, and when. Don’t ask if they can help; tell them what you expect. If they refuse, tell them you will get outside help and they will be expected to contribute financially. You don’t have to do this alone, and you shouldn’t.

You can love your dad and honor his sacrifices without sacrificing yourself. You can set limits without feeling guilty. You are not a terrible child for saying no. You are a responsible adult who is protecting yourself and your dad. That is the best way to love him.

ORIGINAL QUESTION
================================================================================
I am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad's health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become "understood" that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, "Thank you so much, we really appreciate you," but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are "too busy" or "not good with that kind of thing." I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?

BASE MODEL DRAFT RESPONSE
================================================================================
ANSWER: What you’re describing is a deeply challenging and emotionally complex situation. It’s clear you care deeply about your dad and want to honor the role he played in your life, which speaks to your sense of responsibility and love. At the same time, the exhaustion and resentment you’re feeling are important signals that the current arrangement isn’t sustainable or fair to you.

When family caregiving falls heavily on one person, it’s common for others to express gratitude without stepping up, sometimes because they genuinely feel overwhelmed or unsure how to help. That doesn’t erase the impact on you, though, nor does it relieve them of responsibility. Your siblings’ reasons for not taking on tasks—being “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing”—may be sincere, but they also suggest a boundary that they’re unwilling or unable to cross. This leaves you carrying a disproportionate load.

Setting limits doesn’t make you a terrible child; it makes you human. Boundaries are a way to protect your well-being so you can continue to be present for your dad in a way that doesn’t drain you completely. You might start by clearly defining what you can realistically manage and communicating that honestly to your siblings. For example, you could say something like, “I’m committed to helping Dad, but I can’t handle all the appointments and paperwork alone anymore. I need each of you to take on specific tasks that fit your schedules or skills.” Naming concrete actions—like one sibling managing medication refills, another handling bills or insurance calls—can make it easier for them to contribute.

It’s also okay to acknowledge your feelings of guilt and exhaustion openly, both with yourself and your family. Sometimes, sharing your emotional experience can help others understand the weight you’re carrying and motivate them to engage more actively.

Ultimately, caring for a parent is a shared responsibility, and it’s reasonable to expect your siblings to participate in ways that work for them. You don’t have to do this alone, and setting limits is a way to ensure that your care for your dad is sustainable and comes from a place of strength rather than depletion. Taking care of yourself is not abandonment—it’s part of honoring the relationship in a way that respects everyone’s needs, including your own.

- It could be more explicit about the harm of the siblings' inaction and the importance of holding them accountable.
- The advice to share feelings of guilt and exhaustion with family might not be effective if the siblings are not empathetic or responsible.

REVISED_RESPONSE:
You are in a difficult position, and it’s understandable that you feel exhausted and resentful. Your dad’s health is declining, and you have taken on the lion’s share of caregiving responsibilities. Your siblings’ expressions of gratitude are not enough—they need to step up and share the load. Their reasons for not doing so—being “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing”—are excuses that allow them to avoid responsibility. This is unfair to you and unsustainable.

You need to set clear boundaries and hold your siblings accountable. Start by having a frank conversation with them. Tell them, “I am committed to caring for Dad, but I cannot do this alone. I need each of you to take on specific tasks. For example, one of you can manage medication refills, another can handle bills, and the third can communicate with doctors.” Be specific about what you need from each of them and set deadlines for when these tasks should be taken over.

If they continue to avoid responsibility, you need to be prepared to enforce consequences. This might mean limiting the amount of time you spend on caregiving or refusing to do tasks that they have agreed to take on but have not. You might say, “I cannot continue to manage Dad’s appointments if you are not going to help with the paperwork.” This is not abandonment—it’s a necessary step to protect your own well-being.

It’s also important to acknowledge your feelings of guilt and exhaustion, but don’t let these feelings control your actions. You are not a terrible child for setting boundaries—you are a responsible adult who is trying to care for your dad in a sustainable way. Your siblings need to understand that caregiving is a shared responsibility, and they need to step up or face the consequences.

Remember, you are not alone. There are resources available to help caregivers, including support groups and respite care. Don’t be afraid to seek help and to prioritize your own well-being. Your dad needs you to be strong, and you can only be strong if you take care of yourself.

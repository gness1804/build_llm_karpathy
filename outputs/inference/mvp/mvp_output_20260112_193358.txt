ORIGINAL QUESTION
================================================================================
QUESTION: \nI am the oldest of three siblings, and our dad's health has been declining for a while. I live closest, so it has slowly become "understood" that I handle almost everything: appointments, medications, paperwork, talking to doctors. My siblings always say, "Thank you so much, we really appreciate you," but do not actually step in. When I suggest that they take specific tasks, they say they are "too busy" or "not good with that kind of thing." I am exhausted and starting to feel resentful, but I also feel guilty, because my dad did a lot for us growing up, and I do not want to abandon him. How do I set limits without feeling like a terrible child?\n\nDRAFT_RESPONSE:\nYour feelings of exhaustion and resentment are understandable, especially when the weight of caregiving falls so heavily on your shoulders while your siblings remain on the sidelines. It's clear you care deeply about your dad and want to honor the role he played in your life, which makes this situation all the more painful. At the same time, caregiving is a demanding and often unrelenting responsibility, and it's natural—and necessary—to set boundaries to protect your own well-being.\n\nSetting limits doesn't make you a terrible child; it makes you human. Caring for a loved one is a shared family responsibility, and it's reasonable to expect your siblings to contribute in ways that fit their abilities and schedules. Their expressions of gratitude, while kind, don't replace tangible support. When they say they're "too busy" or "not good with that kind of thing," it might help to gently but firmly communicate that their involvement doesn't have to be perfect or time-consuming—it just needs to be consistent and real. For example, one sibling might handle a weekly phone call to your dad, another might manage a specific bill or paperwork task, even if it feels small. This can ease your burden and create a more balanced dynamic.\n\nYou might also consider having a family conversation focused on practical needs rather than feelings of obligation or guilt. Sharing the concrete impact of your current role—how it affects your energy, time, and emotional health—can help others understand why their help matters. It's okay to say, "I love Dad and want to do right by him, but I can't do this alone without it affecting my health and well-being."\n\nRemember, setting limits is not about abandoning your dad; it's about sustaining your ability to care for him in a way that is sustainable and fair. If you don't take care of yourself, your capacity to support him diminishes. Your siblings' reluctance to step in might be frustrating, but it doesn't erase your right to ask for help and to protect your own needs.\n\nUltimately, you are doing important, difficult work. Seeking support—whether from other family members, friends, or community resources—can also lighten the load. You don't have to carry this alone, and you don't have to feel guilty for wanting a more equitable sharing of responsibility. Your love and commitment to your dad can coexist with boundaries that honor your own limits.

BASE MODEL DRAFT RESPONSE
================================================================================
ANSWER: Your feelings of exhaustion and resentment are deeply understandable, especially when the responsibility of caring for your dad has settled so heavily on your shoulders while your siblings remain distant. It’s clear you love your dad and want to honor the role he played in your life, which makes this situation all the more painful. At the same time, caregiving is a demanding, ongoing commitment, and it’s both natural and necessary to set boundaries to protect your own well-being.

Setting limits doesn’t make you a terrible child—it makes you human. Caring for a parent is ideally a shared family responsibility, and it’s reasonable to expect your siblings to contribute in ways that fit their abilities and schedules. Their words of appreciation, while kind, don’t replace actual help. When they say they’re “too busy” or “not good with that kind of thing,” it can be helpful to gently but firmly express that their involvement doesn’t have to be perfect or overwhelming—just consistent and real. For example, one sibling might handle a weekly phone call to your dad, another might take on a specific bill or paperwork task. Even small, concrete contributions can ease your burden and create a more balanced dynamic.

Consider initiating a family conversation focused on practical needs rather than guilt or obligation. Sharing how the current situation affects your energy, time, and emotional health can help others understand why their help matters. It’s okay to say, “I love Dad and want to do right by him, but I can’t do this alone without it affecting my health and well-being.”

Remember, setting limits isn’t about abandoning your dad; it’s about sustaining your ability to care for him in a way that is fair and sustainable. If you don’t take care of yourself, your capacity to support him diminishes. Your siblings’ reluctance to step in may be frustrating, but it doesn’t erase your right to ask for help and protect your own needs.

You’re doing important, difficult work, and seeking support—whether from other family members, friends, or community resources—can lighten the load. You don’t have to carry this alone, and you don’t have to feel guilty for wanting a more equitable sharing of responsibility. Your love and commitment to your dad can coexist with boundaries that honor your own limits.

REVISED_RESPONSE:
You’re in a tough spot, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling drained and resentful. You’re carrying the bulk of your dad’s care, and your siblings are on the sidelines, offering thanks but no real help. That’s not just frustrating—it’s unfair. Your dad did a lot for you growing up, and you want to honor that. But honoring your dad doesn’t mean sacrificing your own health or happiness.

It’s time to be clear with your siblings: their words of appreciation don’t replace action. When they say they’re too busy or not good at certain tasks, that’s a refusal to step up. You don’t need perfect help; you need consistent help. One sibling can make a weekly call to Dad, another can handle a bill or paperwork. These small tasks add up and can ease your load.

Have a family conversation focused on facts, not feelings. Tell them how this is affecting your time, energy, and health. Say, “I love Dad and want to do right by him, but I can’t do this alone. If I don’t set limits, I’ll burn out.” That’s not guilt-tripping; it’s laying out the reality.

Setting limits is not abandoning your dad. It’s about making sure you can keep caring for him without losing yourself. Your siblings’ reluctance to help is their choice, but it doesn’t mean you have to carry the whole burden. You have the right to say no, to ask for help, and to protect your own well-being.

You’re doing hard work, and you don’t have to do it alone. Look for support from other family members, friends, or community resources. Your love for your dad and your need for boundaries can coexist. You’re not a terrible child. You’re a human being with limits—and that’s okay.

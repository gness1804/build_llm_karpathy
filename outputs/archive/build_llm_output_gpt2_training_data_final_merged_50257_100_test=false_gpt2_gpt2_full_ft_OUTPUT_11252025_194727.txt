QUESTION: 
My husband and I have been dating for a couple months. I am planning on having a child with him soon. I have been dating a guy who is going to be in our family for a bit longer. We have had a great relationship and I am very comfortable with him being my husband and my fiance. I have also been having a lot of trouble finding a job and I don't know why I feel that way.

I know I am not the only one in our family to feel that way. I am also the only one who has been to a pregnancy test. I believe the pregnancy test does not give you an answer or any advice as to what to do. I don’t know how to go about deciding whether or not to go ahead with the pregnancy test.

ANSWER:  “How do you tell if you are pregnant”

QUESTION: 
I (21M) have been dating my husband (22F) for 2 years now. 

I’ve always thought he was the best guy in our family. I have been married for 2 years and I have been married for 3 months. I don’t think my husband is that good. When we first met he was really good at what he did. I am not sure how he got a job and maybe he doesn’t feel that way anymore.

I’ve always thought he was the best guy in our family
